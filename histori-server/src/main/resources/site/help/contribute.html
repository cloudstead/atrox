<h1>Contribute to histori.city</h1>

<p>
    In the near future, there will some very important ways that everyone can contribute:
    <ul class="large_spaced_bullets">
    <li>
    <b>Adding new historical information to the map</b>
    <p>histori.city is intended to be a crowd-sourced effort.
    Your participation will be vital in filling the map and making it rich with history.</p>
    </li><li>
    <b>Correcting historical information on the map</b><p>
    Our current data has been auto-imported from Wikipedia. Our import scripts are not perfect.
    Sometimes they make mistakes. By cleaning up some of the existing map data, you help to make the
    service more useful to everyone.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    For the moment, the most important things we need help with are:
    <ul class="large_spaced_bullets">
    <li><b>Spreading the word</b><p>
    Do you like histori.city? Do you know someone who would? Is there a history teacher in your life that should know about this?
    Any amateur historians among your friends? Professional historians? Let other people know about histori.city!
    Send someone a permalink to a cool search you've crafted. They might get a kick out of it too.
</p></li><li>
    <b>Front-end development</b><p>I'm not much of a JavaScript/HTML/CSS developer. I've built histori.city as simply
        and cleanly as I could. I know I've probably done some foolish things that an expert coder will laugh at,
        but I'm pretty sure that same developer would also find the code to be clean, straightforward and relatively easy to follow.
</p><p>
        I've tried to make the
        codebase attractive to a seasoned developer who wants to make it their own and implement an Ember/Angular/React
        framework on top of (or in replacement of) the lightweight jQuery code in place now. If you're interested,
        please <a href="mailto:icanwritecode@histori.city">let me know</a>.
</p></li><li>
    <b>More Wikipedia importers</b>
    <p>We have importers for battles and city/settlement foundings, but there could be so
    many more. Writing an importer is not terribly hard; making the importer more useful by extracting more tags and
    decorations from Wikipedia articles can be a lot of fun.
    </p><p>
    I've pulled together some basic instructions on
    <a href="https://enwiki.histori.city">working with Wikipedia archives</a>,
    which includes information about writing importers. Give it a whirl! If you get stuck we can hash things out on
    <a href="https://bbs.histori.city/c/developers">Developers</a> section of our discussion forums.
