<h2>Nexus</h2>
<p>
    A nexus represents some historical event or state that can span both time and space.
    If you think of histori.city as a geo-temporal version of Wikipedia, then a page on Wikipedia is roughly equivalent to a nexus on histori.city.
    It is the atomic unit of information, and the entire histori.city system is, in one sense, nothing more than the totality of the nexuses that comprise it.
</p>
<p>
    A nexus is known by a name, has a well-defined location in time and space, and may have some tags and commentary attached.
    The attributes of a nexus are described in more detail below.
<ul class="med_spaced_bullets">
    <li><a><b>name</b>: every nexus has a name, <a href="." onclick="toggle_visibility('nexus_canonicalization', '\
        <small><hr/>To reduce the proliferation of similar names, histori.city applies a set of conventions to convert every name into a standard format.\
        <br/>The canonical name of a nexus is obtained by doing the following:\
        <ul>\
            <li>remove all leading and trailing whitespace, considering hyphens and underscores to also be whitespace</li>\
            <li>convert to lowercase</li>\
            <li>convert all spaces and underscores to hyphens</li>\
            <li>any sequential hyphens become a single hyphen</li>\
            <li>URL-encode (to handle any non-URL-safe characters)</li>\
        </ul><hr/></small>'); return false;">unique amongst all others</a>.
        <span id="nexus_canonicalization" style="visibility: hidden;"></span>
    </li>
    <li><b>time</b>: every nexus happened sometime. It can have a start time and an end time.
        If the start and end times are the same, we say the nexus occurred at a particular instant in time.
        If they are different, we say that the nexus spans a time range.</li>
    <li><b>space</b>: every nexus happened somewhere. It could be a single point (latitude/longitude), for example the Battle of Waterloo,
        or it could be a shape (a sequence of latitude/longitude points), for example the extent of the Roman Empire under Trajan.</li>
    <li><b>tags</b>: describes concepts that relate to this nexus; these are described in more detail below.</li>
    <li><b>commentary</b>: free-form text, with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">Markdown</a> support: the written word lives on!</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
    When viewing the histori.city site today, you are seeing only the data we have auto-imported from Wikipedia using
    our <a href="https://enwiki.histori.city">special open source tools</a>.
</p><p>
    When we introduce our new version that allows end users to contribute historical data:
<ul class="med_spaced_bullets">
    <li>
        You will be able to create new nexuses, and designate them as public or private.
    </li><li>
    You will be able to edit any nexus that is visible to you, and other users will be able to edit any nexus that you have made visible to them.
</li><li>
    All nexuses will be versioned. Every edit creates a new version (just like Wikipedia), so nothing is ever lost.
</li><li>
    Different people can have different versions of the same nexus.
</li><li>
    We will exercise some editorial control over which version of a nexus is designated as the public version.
    The default view of our data to anonymous users will be of our designated nexuses.
</li><li>
    When making a designation of whether a nexus should be considered public,
    we will embrace transparency, impartiality, and a clear and shared understanding of rules and standards being applied.
</li><li>
    Regardless of our choice of the "official" version of a nexus, you will be able to set a list of preferred authors
    (and also blocked authors) to customize your own view of histori.city.
</li>
</ul>
