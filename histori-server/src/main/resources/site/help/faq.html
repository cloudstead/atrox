<h3>What is it histori.city?</h3>
<hr/>

<h4>histori.city is a maps app with a time slider</h4>

<p>
    Histori.city is a maps application with a time slider. Just like a regular map app, you can zoom in to focus on a small patch of land, or
    zoom out to view a whole continent. <b>Unlike</b> most other map apps, you can also zoom around in <b>TIME</b>.
    You can zoom down to a examine events on a single day, or zoom out to a millenium to look at broader trends.

    Although the current version does not yet allow user-contributed edits, the long-term vision is for most of the content on
    histori.city to be crowd-sourced, much like Wikipedia.
