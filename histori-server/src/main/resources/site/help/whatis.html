<p style="font-size: larger;">
    <em>The beauty of History is too often obscured by a profusion of prose.</em>
</p>
<!--<hr/>-->

<p>
    I find the irony amusing: by its traditional definition, the very essence of history is the written word.
    Technically, without the written word you don't have history, you have pre-history. In common parlance, the meaning of the word is
    usually construed more broadly; one could even say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Universe">cosmic history</a>
    includes every event that has occurred since the beginning of time.
</p><p>
    Irrespective of how it is defined, the fact remains: the sole format in which a disproportionately huge quantity
    of historical information is available to you is text: a stream of typographic symbols for your eyes to read
    and your brain to process in a sequential manner.
</p><p>
    With no disrespect to the written word (how could I? I'm writing this aren't I?), I assert that there are other ways of
    understanding history: more visual ways, more non-sequential and non-linear ways, more interactive ways.
</p><p>
    histori.city is my attempt to explore some of those new ways. Towards that end, I say:
    <br/><br/>
    <em>History doesn't happen in books. History happens at specific times and places, right here on planet Earth.</em>
    <br/><br/>
    <b>histori.city seeks to record every piece of history on an interactive, collaboratively-editable map</b>
</p>
<p>
    That being said, histori.city is most definitely a work-in-progress. What you see today is just a glimpse of what can be done.
</p>

<br/><hr/>
<h4><img height="24" src="../images/earth.png"/> What is histori.city?</h4>

<p>
    Histori.city is a history book, spread across space and time.
</p><p>
    Like any other map-oriented application, you can zoom in to a small patch of land, or zoom out to whole continent.
</p><p>
    <b>Unlike</b> most other map apps, you can also zoom around <b>time</b>.
    You can zoom down to a single day, or zoom out to a millennium.
</p><p>
    Within your chosen space-time view, you can run searches and see the results appear on both the map and the timeline.
</p><p>
    You can bookmark your searches. You can create permalinks to share your bookmarks with friends.
</p>

<p>
    Although the current version does not yet allow user-contributed edits, the long-term vision is for most of the content on
    histori.city to be crowd-sourced, much like Wikipedia.
</p>

<br/><hr/>
<h4><img height="24" src="../images/earth.png"/> What are some key concepts I should understand?</h4>

<p>
    The information stored in histori.city is organized around a few core concepts: Nexus, Tag, and Decoration.
</p>
<ul class="med_spaced_bullets">
    <li>Each <b>nexus</b> is represented by a marker on the map and a marker on the timeline.</li>
    <li><b>Tags</b> are attached to nexuses; a tag ties a concept to a nexus.</li>
    <li><b>Decorations</b> are attached to tags; a decoration describes how its tag applies to its nexus.</li>
</ul>
Learn more about
<a class="no_change_target" href="nexus.html">Nexuses</a>,
<a class="no_change_target" href="tag.html">Tags</a> and
<a class="no_change_target" href="decoration.html">Decorations</a>.

<br/><br/><hr/>
<h4><img height="24" src="../images/earth.png"/> Why do I only see battles and city foundings?</h4>

<p>
    TLDR: it was relatively easy to load these events from Wikipedia.
</p>
<b>Soon, there will be much more.</b>
<p>
    In the long run, the idea is for histori.city to be maintained by the public. But it's difficult to start from a blank slate.
    By pre-loading content from Wikipedia, it is much easier to see what histori.city is all about and how much fun it can be to play with.
</p>

<br/><hr/>
<h4><img height="24" src="../images/earth.png"/> What kinds of open source software is histori.city built upon?</h4>

<p>
    I'm so glad you asked. Like many open source projects today, histori.city stands on the shoulders of
    <a class="no_change_target" href="legal.html?t=licenses">an army of giants</a>.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The <a href="https://github.com/cloudstead/histori">core of histori.city</a> is a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a>-ish
        <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> server written in <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Internally, the server extends the <a href="https://github.com/cobbzilla/cobbzilla-wizard">cobbzilla-wizard</a> framework.
        Inspired by Coda Hale's well-regarded <a href="http://dropwizard.io/">Dropwizard</a> framework, cobbzilla-wizard
        provides an embedded <a href="https://grizzly.java.net/">Grizzly</a> web server,
        <a href="https://jersey.java.net/">Jersey</a>/<a href="https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/">JAX-RS</a> resources,
        a <a href="http://www.springframework.net/">Spring</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control">IoC container</a>,
        and lots more.
    </li>
    <li>
        Data is stored across several <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> shards using a custom built
        <a href="http://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> shard engine.
    </li>
    <li>
        We use <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> for caching.
    </li>
    <li>
        The frontend is a lightweight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> client
        built on <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        We use a bunch of icons from <a href="https://useiconic.com/open">Open Iconic</a>,
        a few <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQueryUI</a> components,
        and <a href="https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown">Showdown</a> for converting markdown to HTML.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache 2</a> handles our connection management, SSL termination and proxying requests to the Java server.
    </li>
    <li>
        Search indexing is provided by an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">ElasticSearch</a> cluster.
    </li>
    <li>
        Our systems are powered by <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> <a href="https://gnu.org">GNU</a>/<a href="https://kernel.org">Linux</a>,
        hosted by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon AWS</a> and provisioned by <a href="https://www.chef.io/">Chef</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        We're also big fans of <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">Jackson</a> and <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">Lombok</a>
        which have made developing histori.city easier and more fun.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We're always looking for help, so if you have coding skills please
    <a href="https://github.com/cloudstead/histori">check out our source</a> and have some fun with it.
    Code contributions are always welcome.
</p>
<p>
    We are particularly looking for help with the frontend: if you know Ember, Angular or React and are interested in
    making the histori.city UI/UX something truly extraordinary, please <a href="mailto:icanwritecode@histori.city">let me know</a>.
