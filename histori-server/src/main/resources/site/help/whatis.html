<h1>
    <em>Far too often, the beauty of history is obscured by a profusion of prose.</em>
</h1>
<p>
    Does an excess of text turn history into something ugly and boring?
    Many would agree, and the irony is amusing: by its traditional definition, the written word is the very essence of history.
    Technically, without the written word you don't have history, you have pre-history. In common parlance, the definition is
    usually construed more broadly; one could say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Universe">cosmic history</a>
    includes every event since the beginning of time.
</p><p>
    Regardless of how you define it, the fact remains: the sole format in which most historical information is available to you is text;
    a stream of typographic symbols for your eyes to read and your brain to process in a sequential manner.
</p><p>
    With no disrespect to the written word (it sure is useful right here, isn't it?) I assert that there are other ways to
    understand history: more visual ways, more non-linear ways, more interactive ways.
</p><p>
    histori.city is my attempt to explore some of those new ways. Towards that end, I say:
    <br/><br/>
    <em>History doesn't happen in text. History happens at specific times and places, right here on planet Earth.</em>
    <br/><br/>
    <b>histori.city seeks to record every piece of history on an interactive, collaboratively-editable map</b>
</p>
<p>
    That being said, histori.city is most definitely a work-in-progress. What you see today is just a glimpse of what can be done.
</p>

<br/><hr/>
<h4><img height="24" src="/images/earth.png"/> What is histori.city?</h4>

<p>
    Histori.city is a history book, spread across space and time.<br/>
    It's a maps app crossed with a time machine.<br/>
    It's a geo-temporal wikipedia of world history.
</p><p>
    Like any other map-oriented application, you can zoom in to a small patch of land, or zoom out to whole continent.
</p><p>
    <em>Unlike</em> most other map apps, you can also zoom around <em>time</em>.
    You can zoom down to a single day, or zoom out to a millennium.
</p><p>
    Within your chosen space-time view, you can run searches and see the results appear on both the map and the timeline.
</p><p>
    You can bookmark your searches. You can create permalinks to share your bookmarks with friends.
</p>

<p>
    Soon: anything you can see on the map, you can edit. Add or remove tags. Adjust the location or time.
    Every edit creates a new version, preserving previous versions.
    Although our current version does not yet allow user-contributed edits, the long-term vision is for most of the content on
    histori.city to be crowd-sourced, much like Wikipedia.
</p>

<br/><hr/>
<h4><img height="24" src="/images/earth.png"/> What are some key concepts I should understand?</h4>

<p>
    The information in histori.city is organized around a few core concepts: Nexus, Tag, and Decoration.
</p>
<ul class="med_spaced_bullets">
    <li>Each <b>nexus</b> is represented by a marker on the map and a corresponding marker on the timeline.</li>
    <li><b>Tags</b> are attached to nexuses; a tag ties a concept to a nexus.</li>
    <li><b>Decorations</b> are attached to tags; a decoration describes how its tag applies to its nexus.</li>
</ul>
Learn more about
<a class="no_change_target" href="nexus.html">Nexuses</a>,
<a class="no_change_target" href="tag.html">Tags</a> and
<a class="no_change_target" href="decoration.html">Decorations</a>.

<br/><br/><hr/>
<h4><img height="24" src="/images/earth.png"/> Why do I only see battles and city foundings?</h4>

<p>
    TLDR: it was relatively easy to import these events from Wikipedia.
</p>
<b>Soon, there will be much more.</b>
<p>
    In the long run, the idea is for histori.city to be maintained by the public. But it's difficult to start from a blank slate.
    By pre-loading content from Wikipedia, it is much easier to see what histori.city is all about and how much fun it can be to play with.
</p>

<br/><hr/>
<h4><img height="24" src="/images/earth.png"/> What open source software is histori.city built upon?</h4>

<p>
    I'm so glad you asked. Like many open source projects today, histori.city stands on the shoulders of
    <a class="no_change_target" href="/help/legal.html?t=licenses">an army of giants</a>.
