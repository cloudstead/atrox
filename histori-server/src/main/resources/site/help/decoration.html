<h2>Decoration</h2>
<p>
    Just as a nexus can have many tags, a tag can have many decorations.
</p><p>
    Tags, and decorations on tags, are a big part of what makes histori.city so fun to play with. By exploring common
    themes across time and space, you can discover events in history you never knew about and find fascinating connections between events
    that might leave you scratching your head.
</p><p>
    A decoration qualifies <em>how</em> the tag applies to the nexus.
</p><p>
    For example, in the nexus 'Battle of Waterloo', there is a 'person: Napoleon' tag attached.
    This tells us that Napoleon was associated with this event, but how?
</p><p>
    There are two decorations attached to the 'person: Napoleon' tag:
    <ul class="sm_spaced_bullets">
      <li>role: commander</li>
      <li>world actor: France</li>
    </ul>
    So Napoleon's role at the Battle of Waterloo was as commander of the French.
</p><p>

<h4>What decorations are allowed on a tag?</h4>
    There are different rules for which decorations are allowed on which tags. For the most part, the user interface tries to make this
    so easy you don't even need to think about it.
</p><p>
<h5>comment</h5>
    You can put 'comment' decorations on any tag.
</p><p>
<h5>see_also</h5>
    You can put 'see_also' decorations on just about anything, except Meta tags.
</p><p>
    A 'see_also' decoration can point to any other tag or nexus, or even be a free-form URL or text reference.
</p><p>
<h5>Tags without other decorations</h5>
    The 'event type' and 'idea' tags do not allow any other decorations other than 'see_also'.
</p><p>
<h5>Tags with decorations</h5>
    The table below lists which kinds of decorations can be attached to which kinds of tags.
</p>
<table border="0">
    <table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="10">
        <thead>
        <tr><th nowrap width="20%" align="center">tag type</th><th nowrap align="center">decorations</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="tagTypeCell">event</td>
            <td>
                <table class="faqDecorator">
                    <tbody><tr><td class="faqDecoratorName">relationship</td><td>
                        how this event relates to the one named in the tag.
                        For example, the Battle of Gettysburg might have an 'event' tag named 'American Civil War'.<br/>
                        That tag has the decoration: 'relationship: part of'<br/>
                        This indicates that the nature of this nexus's relationship
                        to the tag (American Civil War), is that it was a part of that larger event.
                    </td></tr></tbody>

                        the role that this world actor played in relation to the nexus.
                        For example, most of the battle nexuses include World Actor tags that have a 'role: combatant' decoration.

You can attach multiple decorations of the same type to a single tag, as long as their values are different.
For example, a Person tag might have multiple 'role' decorations.
