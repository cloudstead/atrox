<h2>Decoration</h2>
<p>
    Just as a nexus can have many tags, a tag can have many decorations. A decoration qualifies <em>how</em>
    the tag applies to the nexus. For example, in the nexus 'Battle of Waterloo', a 'person' tag for 'Napoleon' is attached.
    This tells us that Napoleon was associated with the event, but how? The decorations tell us: there is a 'role' decoration with the value
    'commander', and a 'world actor' decoration with the value 'France'.
    Now we know that Napoleon's role at the Battle of Waterloo was as commander of the French.
</p><p>
    There are different rules for which decorations are allowed on which tags. For the most part, the user interface tries to make this
    so easy you don't even need to think about it.
</p><p>
    All tags, except Meta tags, can have multiple 'see_also' decorations, these can point to
    any other tag or nexus, or even be a free-form URL or text reference.
</p><p>
    The 'event type' and 'idea' tags do not take any other decorations. The decorations you can put on the other
    kinds of tags are described in the table below.

<table border="0">
    <table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="10">
        <thead>
        <tr><th nowrap width="20%" align="center">tag type</th><th nowrap align="center">decorations</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td class="tagTypeCell">event</td>

                <table class="faqDecorator">
                    <tbody><tr><td class="faqDecoratorName">relationship</td><td>
                        how this event relates to the one named in the tag. For example, the Battle of Gettysburg might have an 'event' tag named 'American Civil War'. That tag would have a relationship decoration whose value was 'part of', indicating that this nexus was a part of some larger event.
