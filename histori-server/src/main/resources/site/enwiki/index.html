<h1>Wikipedia Tools at histori.city</h1>

<em>This is a work in progress. Stay tuned for updates as we fill out the information available here.</em>

<p>
In order to import so much data onto the <a href="https://alpha3.histori.city">histori.city</a> map,
we had to write a number of tools to work with such a large data set.
We thought other people might find them useful, so we have tried to make that as easy as possible.
</p>
<p>
If you are looking for programmatic access to the entire set of articles from the English language Wikipedia,
you've come to the right place.
</p>
<p>
Using histori.city tools, you can retrieve the contents of any Wikipedia article with a single HTTP request.
You can navigate a structured object model of the article, with support for nested structures
including infoboxes, plainlists, links, and more.
</p>
<p>
You can even write importers that will transform Wikipedia pages into histori.city Nexuses.
You can then import these onto your histori.city map.
</p>

<h3>Using the Tools</h3>

<p>
You will need a Java 7 JDK installed. Then <a href="https://github.com/cloudstead/histori">download the code</a>. You will use the the run.sh (or run.bat) script to run commands, or use the library
directly from your Java code.
</p>

<p>
You will also need an Amazon account and AWS access credentials to access the S3 bucket that contains the JSON files.
