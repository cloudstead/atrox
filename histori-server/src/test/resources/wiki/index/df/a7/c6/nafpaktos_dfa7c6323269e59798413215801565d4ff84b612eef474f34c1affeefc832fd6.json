Nafpaktos is situated on a bay on the north coast of the [[Gulf of Corinth]], {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} west of the mouth of the river [[Mornos]]. The harbour is accessible only to the smallest craft. It is {{convert|9|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Antirrio]], {{convert|18|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Patras]], {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Missolonghi]] and {{convert|45|km|0|abbr=on}} southeast of Agrinio. The [[Greek National Road 48]]/[[European route E65|E65]] (Antirrio - Nafpaktos - [[Delphi]] - [[Livadeia]]) passes north of the town. It is the third largest town of Aetolia-Acarnania, after [[Agrinio]] and [[Missolonghi]].\nThe 1571 [[Battle of Lepanto]], in which the navy of the Ottoman Empire was decisively defeated by the [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]] assembled by [[Pius V|Pope Pius V]], is named for Naupactus under the Italian form of its name.\nSince the 2011 local government reform, it has been part of the municipality of [[Nafpaktia]], of which it is the seat and a municipal unit.&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n==Name==\nThe name '''Naupaktos''' means &quot;boatyard&quot;, from �������� (ancient Greek ''naus'', meaning &quot;ship&quot;) and ���������������� (Ancient Greek ''p��gnuein'' meaning &quot;to build&quot;). It was later [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] as '''Naupactus'''. In the [[Byzantine]] period, the name became '''Epachtos''' (��������������), while the Venetian term was '''Lepanto''' and the Ottoman Turkish '''��nebaht��'''. The ancient name was revived in the 19th century.\n==History==\n===Antiquity===\nIn Greek legend, Naupactus is the place where the [[Heraclidae]] built a fleet to invade the [[Peloponnese]].\nIn historical times it belonged to the [[Ozolian Locris|Ozolian Locrians]]; but about 455 BC, in spite of a partial resettlement with Locrians of [[Opus, Greece|Opus]], it [[Battle of Naupactus (429 BC)|fell]] to the [[Ancient Athens|Athenians]], who peopled it with [[Messenia]]n refugees and made it their chief naval station in western Greece during the [[Peloponnesian war]]. Two major battles were fought here.  In 404 it was restored to the Locrians, who subsequently lost it to the [[Achaea]]ns, but recovered it.\n[[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] of [[Macedon]] gave Naupactus to the Aetolians, who held it till 191 BC, when after an obstinate siege it was surrendered to the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. It was still flourishing about 170.\nThe Roman playwright [[Plautus]] mentions Naupactus in his comedy [[Miles Gloriosus]] as the destination of an Athenian master (Pleusicles) who is on a diplomatic mission to the city.\nIn 551/2, during the reign of [[Justinian I]], the city was destroyed by an earthquake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Veikou&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Byzantine Epirus: A Topography of Transformation.
