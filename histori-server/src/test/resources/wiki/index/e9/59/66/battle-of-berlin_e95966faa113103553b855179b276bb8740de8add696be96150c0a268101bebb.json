The [[Battle in Berlin|battle within the city]] lasted from 20 April until the morning of 2 May.\nThe first defensive preparations at the outskirts of Berlin were made on 20 March, when the newly appointed commander of [[Army Group Vistula]], General [[Gotthard Heinrici]], correctly anticipated that the main Soviet thrust would be made over the [[Oder River]]. Before the main battle in Berlin commenced, the Soviets managed to encircle the city as a result of their success in the battles of the [[Battle of the Seelow Heights|Seelow Heights]] and [[Battle of Halbe|Halbe]]. During 20 April 1945, the [[1st Belorussian Front]] led by [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Georgy Zhukov]] started shelling Berlin's city centre, while Marshal [[Ivan Konev]]'s [[1st Ukrainian Front]] had pushed from the south through the last formations of [[Army Group Centre]]. The German defences were mainly led by [[Helmuth Weidling]] and consisted of several depleted, badly equipped, and disorganised [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Waffen-SS]] divisions, the latter of which included many [[Waffen-SS foreign volunteers and conscripts|SS foreign volunteers]], as well as poorly trained ''[[Volkssturm]]'' and [[Hitler Youth]] members. Within the next few days, the Soviets rapidly advanced through the city and reached the city centre where close-quarters combat raged.\nBefore the battle was over, German [[F��hrer]] [[Adolf Hitler]] and a number of his followers committed suicide. The city's defenders finally surrendered on 2 May; however, fighting continued to the north-west, west, and south-west of the city until the [[End of World War II in Europe|end of the war in Europe]] on 8 May (9 May in the Soviet Union) as German units fought westward so that they could surrender to the [[Western Allies]] rather than to the Soviets.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=400-405}}\n==Background==\n[[File:Battle of Berlin 1945-a.png|thumb|left|Main thrusts of the Red Army and its eastern allies.|alt=Red Army attacks]]\n[[File:Battle of Berlin 1945-b.png|thumb|left|German counter-attacks.|alt=Berlin operation]]\nStarting on 12 January 1945, the Red Army began the [[Vistula���Oder Offensive]] across the [[Narew]] River; and, from Warsaw, a three-day operation on a broad front, which incorporated four army [[Front (Soviet Army)|Front]]s.{{sfn|Duffy|1991|pp=24, 25}} On the fourth day, the Red Army broke out and started moving west, up to {{convert|30|to|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} per day, taking [[East Prussia]], [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]], and [[Pozna��]], drawing up on a line {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Berlin along the [[Oder]] River.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=295}}\nThe newly created [[Army Group Vistula]], under the command of ''[[Reichsf��hrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]],{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=52}} [[Operation Solstice|attempted a counter-attack]], but this had failed by 24 February.{{sfn|Duffy|1991|pp=176���188}} The Red Army then drove on to [[Pomerania]], clearing the right bank of the Oder River, thereby reaching into [[Silesia]].{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=295}}\nIn the south the [[Siege of Budapest]] raged. Three German attempts to relieve the encircled Hungarian capital city failed, and Budapest fell to the Soviets on 13 February.{{sfn|Duffy|1991|p=293}} [[Adolf Hitler]] insisted on a counter-attack to recapture the Drau-Danube triangle.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=8}} The goal was to secure the oil region of [[Nagykanizsa]] and regain the [[Danube]] River for future operations, {{sfn|Tiemann|1998|p=200}} but the depleted German forces had been given an impossible task.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=9}} By 16 March, the German [[Operation Fr��hlingserwachen|Lake Balaton Offensive]] had failed, and a counter-attack by the Red Army took back in 24 hours everything the Germans had taken ten days to gain.{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=198}} On 30 March, the Soviets entered Austria; and in the [[Vienna Offensive]] they finally captured [[Vienna]] on 13 April.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=196}}\nBetween June and September 1944, the [[Wehrmacht]] had lost more than a million men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively.{{sfn|Williams|2005|p=213}} On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had died.{{sfn|Bullock|1962|p=753}} This briefly raised false hopes in the ''[[F��hrerbunker]]'' that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had happened once before when Berlin was threatened (see the [[Miracle of the House of Brandenburg]]).{{sfn|Bullock|1962|pp=778���781}}\nNo plans were made by the [[Western Allies]] to seize the city by a ground operation.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=194}} The [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Commander &amp;#91;Western&amp;#93; Allied Expeditionary Force]], General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] lost interest in the [[race to Berlin]] and saw no further need to suffer casualties by attacking a city that would be in the Soviet [[sphere of influence]] after the war,{{sfn|Williams|2005|pp=310, 311}} envisioning excessive [[friendly fire]] if both armies attempted to occupy the city at once.{{sfn|Ryan|1966|p=135}} The major Western Allied contribution to the battle was the [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing of Berlin]] during 1945.{{sfn|Milward|1980|p=303}} During 1945 the [[United States Army Air Forces]] launched a number of very large daytime raids on Berlin and for 36 nights in succession, scores of [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[De Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]]s bombed the German capital, ending on the night of 20/21 April 1945 just before the Soviets entered the city.{{sfn|McInnis|1946|p=115}}\n==Preparations==\n{{further|Order of battle for the Battle of Berlin}}\nThe Soviet offensive into central Germany, what later became [[East Germany]], had two objectives. [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] did not believe the Western Allies would hand over territory occupied by them in the post-war Soviet zone, so he began the offensive on a broad front and moved rapidly to meet the Western Allies as far west as possible. But the overriding objective was to capture Berlin.{{sfn|Beevor|2003|p=219}} The two goals were complementary because possession of the zone could not be won quickly unless Berlin were taken. Another consideration was that Berlin itself held useful post-war strategic assets, including Adolf Hitler and the [[German nuclear energy project|German atomic bomb programme]].{{sfn|Beevor|2002|loc=Preface xxxiv, and pp. 138, 325}} On 6 March, Hitler appointed [[Lieutenant General]] [[Helmuth Reymann]] commander of the Berlin Defence Area, replacing Lieutenant General [[Bruno Ritter von Hauenschild]].{{sfn|Beevor|2003|p=166}}\nOn 20 March, General [[Gotthard Heinrici]] was appointed Commander-in-Chief of [[Army Group Vistula]] replacing ''[[Reichsf��hrer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]].{{sfn|Beevor|2003|p=140}} Heinrici was one of the best defensive tacticians in the German army, and he immediately started to lay defensive plans. Heinrici correctly assessed that the main Soviet thrust would be made over the [[Oder River]] and along the [[Bundesautobahn 12|main east-west Autobahn]].{{sfn|Williams|2005|p=292}} He decided not to try to defend the banks of the Oder with anything more than a light [[skirmishing]] screen. Instead, Heinrici arranged for [[Military engineers|engineers]] to fortify the [[Seelow Heights]], which overlooked the Oder River at the point where the Autobahn crossed them.{{sfn|Zuljan|2003}} This was some distance {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the Oder and {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Berlin. Heinrici thinned out the line in other areas to increase the manpower available to defend the heights. German engineers turned the Oder's flood plain, already saturated by the spring thaw, into a [[swamp]] by releasing the water from a [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] upstream. Behind the plain on the plateau, the engineers built three belts of defensive emplacements{{sfn|Zuljan|2003}} reaching back towards the outskirts of Berlin (the lines nearer to Berlin were called the ''Wotan'' position).{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=76}} These lines consisted of [[anti-tank]] ditches, anti-tank gun emplacements, and an extensive network of [[Trench warfare|trenches]] and [[bunkers]].{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=76}}{{sfn|Zuljan|2003}}\nOn 9 April, after a long resistance, [[K��nigsberg]] in [[East Prussia]] finally fell to the Red Army.{{sfn|Williams|2005|p=293}} This freed up Marshal [[Rokossovsky]]'s [[2nd Belorussian Front]] to move west to the east bank of the [[Oder]] river.{{sfn|Williams|2005|p=293}} Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] concentrated his [[1st Belorussian Front]], which had been deployed along the Oder river from [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt]] in the south to the Baltic, into an area in front of the [[Seelow Heights]].{{sfn|Williams|2005|p=322}} The 2nd Belorussian Front moved into the positions being vacated by the 1st Belorussian Front north of the Seelow Heights. While this redeployment was in progress, gaps were left in the lines; and the remnants of General [[Dietrich von Saucken]]'s [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|German II Army]], which had been bottled up in a pocket near [[Danzig]], managed to escape into the [[Vistula|Vistula Delta]].{{sfn|Beevor|2003|p=426}} To the south, Marshal [[Konev]] shifted the main weight of the [[1st Ukrainian Front]] out of [[Upper Silesia]] and north-west to the [[Lusatian Neisse|Neisse]] River.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=71}}\nThe three Soviet fronts had altogether 2.5 million men (including 78,556 soldiers of the [[First Polish Army (1944-1945)|1st Polish Army]]), 6,250 tanks, 7,500 aircraft, 41,600 [[artillery]] pieces and [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s, 3,255 truck-mounted [[Katyusha rocket launcher]]s (nicknamed 'Stalin's Pipe Organs'), and 95,383 motor vehicles, many manufactured in the US.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=71}}\n==Battle of the Oder���Neisse==\n{{main|Battle of the Oder���Neisse}}\nThe sector in which most of the fighting in the overall offensive took place was the [[Seelow Heights]], the last major defensive line outside Berlin.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=76}} The [[Battle of the Seelow Heights]], fought over four days from 16 April until 19 April, was one of the last [[pitched battle]]s of World War II: Almost one million Red Army soldiers and more than 20,000 tanks and artillery pieces were deployed to break through the &quot;Gates to Berlin&quot;, which were defended by about 100,000 German soldiers and 1,200 tanks and guns.{{sfn|Gregory|Gehlen|2009|pp=207���208}}{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=217���233}} The Soviet forces led by Zhukov broke through the defensive positions, having suffered about 20,000 casualties (including 5,000 to 6,000 killed),{{sfn|Isaev|2010}} while 12,000 German personnel were killed.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=244}}\nDuring 19 April, the fourth day, the 1st Belorussian Front broke through the final line of the Seelow Heights; and nothing but broken German formations lay between them and Berlin.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=247}} The 1st Ukrainian Front, having captured [[Forst (Lausitz)|Forst]] the day before, was fanning out into open country.{{sfn|Beevor|2003|p=255}} One powerful thrust by [[Vasily Gordov|Gordov]]'s [[Soviet Third Guards Army|3rd Guards Army]] and [[P.S. Rybalko|Rybalko]]'s [[3rd Guards Tank Army|3rd]] and [[D.D. Lelyushenko|Lelyushenko]]'s [[4th Tank Army (Soviet Union)|4th Guards]] Tank Armies were heading north-east towards Berlin while other armies headed west towards a section of the United States Army's front line south-west of Berlin on the [[Elbe]].{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=312���314}} With these advances, the Soviet forces drove a wedge between the German [[Army Group Vistula]] in the north and [[Army Group Centre]] in the south.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=312���314}} By the end of the day, the German eastern front line north of Frankfurt around Seelow and to the south around Forst had ceased to exist. These breakthroughs allowed the two Soviet [[Front (Soviet Army)|Fronts]] to [[double-envelopment|envelop]] the German [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]] in a large pocket west of Frankfurt. Attempts by the 9th Army to break out to the west resulted in the [[Battle of Halbe]].{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=217���233}} The cost to the Soviet forces had been very high, with over 2,807 tanks lost between 1 and 19 April, including at least 727 at the Seelow Heights.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=84}}\nIn the meantime, [[de Havilland Mosquito|RAF Mosquitoes]] were conducting large [[Tactical bombing|tactical air raids]] against German positions inside Berlin on the nights of 15 April (105 bombers), 17 April (61 bombers), 18 April (57 bombers), 19 April (79 bombers), and 20 April (78 bombers).{{sfn|RAF staff|2006}}\n==Encirclement of Berlin==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-G0627-500-001, Auszeichnung des Hitlerjungen Willi H��bner.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Photo of Willi H��bner awarded the Iron Cross II Class medal]]\nOn 20 April 1945, Hitler's 56th birthday, Soviet artillery of the [[1st Belorussian Front]] began shelling Berlin and did not stop until the city surrendered. The weight of ordnance delivered by Soviet artillery during the battle was greater than the total tonnage dropped by Western Allied bombers on the city.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=255���256, 262}} While the 1st Belorussian Front advanced towards the east and north-east of the city, the 1st Ukrainian Front pushed through the last formations of the northern wing of Army Group Centre and passed north of [[Juterbog]], well over halfway to the American front line on the river [[Elbe]] at [[Magdeburg]].{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=337}} To the north between [[Stettin]] and [[Schwedt]], the 2nd Belorussian Front attacked the northern flank of [[Army Group Vistula]], held by [[Hasso von Manteuffel]]'s [[3rd Panzer Army|III Panzer Army]].{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=84}} The next day, [[Semen Bogdanov|Bogdanov]]'s [[2nd Guards Tank Army]] advanced nearly {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Berlin and then attacked south-west of [[Werneuchen]]. The Soviet plan was to encircle Berlin first and then envelop the IX Army.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=88}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J31305, Auszeichnung des Hitlerjungen Willi H��bner.jpg|thumb|9 March 1945, [[Joseph Goebbels]] handing Iron Cross II class to 16-year-old Hitler Youth Willi H��bner after capture of [[Lauban]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1985-092-29, vor Berlin, Volkssturm mit Panzerabwehrwaffe.jpg|thumb|[[Volkssturmmann]] with [[Panzerschreck]], Berlin, April 1945]]\nThe command of the [[German V Corps]], trapped with the IX Army north of [[Forst (Lausitz)|Forst]], passed from the IV Panzer Army to the IX Army. The corps was still holding on to the Berlin-[[Cottbus]] highway front line.{{sfn|Simons|1982|p=78}} Field Marshal [[Ferdinand Sch��rner]]'s Army Group Centre launched a counter-offensive aimed at breaking through to Berlin from the south and making a successful initial incursion (the [[Battle of Bautzen (1945)|Battle of Bautzen]]) in the 1st Ukrainian Front region, engaging the [[Polish Second Army|2nd Polish Army]] and elements of the Red Army's [[52nd Army (Soviet Union)|52nd Army]] and [[5th Guards Army]].{{sfn|Komorowski|2009|pp=65���67}} When the old southern flank of the IV Panzer Army had some local successes counter-attacking north against the 1st Ukrainian Front, Hitler gave orders that showed his grasp of military reality was completely gone. He ordered the IX Army to hold Cottbus and set up a front facing west.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=345}} Then they were to attack the Soviet columns advancing north. This would supposedly allow them to form a northern pincer that would meet the IV Panzer Army coming from the south and envelop the 1st Ukrainian Front before destroying it.{{sfn|Beevor|2003|p=248}} They were to anticipate a southward attack by the III Panzer Army and be ready to be the southern arm of a pincer attack that would envelop 1st Belorussian Front, which would be destroyed by SS-General [[Felix Steiner]]'s [[Army Detachment Steiner|Army Detachment]] advancing from north of Berlin.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=310���312}} Later in the day, when Steiner explained that he did not have the divisions to do this, Heinrici made it clear to Hitler's staff that unless the IX Army retreated immediately, it would be enveloped by the Soviets. He stressed that it was already too late for it to move north-west to Berlin and would have to retreat west.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=310���312}} Heinrici went on to say that if Hitler did not allow it to move west, he would ask to be relieved of his command.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|pp=87���88}}\nOn 22 April, at his afternoon situation conference, Hitler fell into a tearful rage when he understood that his plans of the day before were not going to be realised. He declared that the war was lost; he blamed the generals and announced that he would stay on in Berlin until the end and then kill himself.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=275}} In an attempt to coax Hitler out of his rage, General [[Alfred Jodl]] speculated that General [[Walther Wenck]]'s [[12th Army (Wehrmacht)|XII Army]], which was facing the Americans, could move to Berlin because the Americans, already on the [[Elbe]] River, were unlikely to move further east. This assumption was based on his viewing of the captured Eclipse documents, which organized the partition of Germany among the Allies.{{sfn|Ryan|1966|p=436}} Hitler immediately grasped the idea, and within hours Wenck was ordered to disengage from the Americans and move the XII Army north-east to support Berlin.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=310���312}} It was then realised that if the IX Army moved west, it could link up with the XII Army. In the evening Heinrici was given permission to make the link-up.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=89}}\nElsewhere, the 2nd Belorussian Front had established a bridgehead {{convert|15|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} deep on the west bank of the Oder and was heavily engaged with the III Panzer Army.{{sfn|Beevor|2003|p=353}} The IX Army had lost [[Cottbus]] and was being pressed from the east. A Soviet tank spearhead was on the [[Havel]] River to the east of Berlin, and another had at one point penetrated the inner defensive ring of Berlin.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=92}}\nThe capital was now within range of field artillery. A Soviet war correspondent, in the style of World War II Soviet journalism, gave the following account of an important event that day:{{sfn|Lewis|1998|p=465}}\n{{quote|On the walls of the houses we saw [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]]' appeals, hurriedly scrawled in white paint: 'Every German will defend his capital. We shall stop the Red hordes at the walls of our Berlin.' Just try and stop them!&lt;br /&gt;\nSteel [[Pillbox (military)|pillbox]]es, barricades, mines, traps, suicide squads with grenades clutched in their hands���all are swept aside before the tidal wave.&lt;br /&gt;\nDrizzling rain began to fall. Near [[Bisdorf]] I saw batteries preparing to open fire.&lt;br /&gt;\n'What are the targets?' I asked the battery commander.&lt;br /&gt;\n'Centre of Berlin, [[Spree]] bridges, and the northern and [[Stettin]] railway stations,' he answered.&lt;br /&gt;\nThen came the tremendous words of command: 'Open fire on the capital of Fascist Germany.'&lt;br /&gt;\nI noted the time.

By now there were about 10,000 German soldiers in the city centre, which were being assaulted from all sides. One of the other main thrusts was along Wilhelmstrasse on which the Air Ministry, built of [[reinforced concrete]], was pounded by large concentrations of Soviet artillery.{{sfn|Beevor|2003|p=380}} The remaining German Tiger tanks of the [[Hermann von Salza]] battalion took up positions in the east of the Tiergarten to defend the centre against [[Vasily Kuznetsov (general)|Kuznetsov]]'s 3rd Shock Army (which although heavily engaged around the Reichstag was also flanking the area by advancing through the northern Tiergarten) and the 8th Guards Army advancing through the south of the Tiergarten.{{sfn|Beevor|2003|p=381}} These Soviet forces had effectively cut the sausage-shaped area held by the Germans in half and made any escape attempt to the west for German troops in the centre much more difficult.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=385���386}}\nDuring the early hours of 1 May, Krebs talked to General Chuikov, commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dollinger|1967|p=239}}, states 3&amp;nbsp;am, and {{harvnb|Beevor|2003|p=391}}, 4&amp;nbsp;am, for Krebs' meeting with Chuikov&lt;/ref&gt; informing him of Hitler's death and a willingness to negotiate a city wide surrender.{{sfn|Beevor|2003|p=391}} However, they could not agree on terms because of Soviet insistence on unconditional surrender and Krebs' claim that he lacked authorisation to agree to that.{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=239}} Goebbels was against surrender. In the afternoon, Goebbels and his wife (after [[Goebbels children#Last days|killing their children]]) committed suicide.{{sfn|Beevor|2003|p=405}} Goebbels's death removed the last impediment which prevented Weidling from accepting the terms of unconditional surrender of his garrison, but he chose to delay the surrender until the next morning to allow the planned breakout to take place under the cover of darkness.{{sfn|Beevor|2003|p=406}}\n===Breakout and surrender===\nOn the night of 1/2 May, most of the remnants of the Berlin garrison attempted to break out of the city centre in three different directions. Only those that went west through the Tiergarten and crossed the [[Charlottenbr��cke]] (a bridge over the [[Havel]]) into [[Spandau]] succeeded in breaching Soviet lines.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=383���389}} However, only a handful of those who survived the initial breakout made it to the lines of the Western Allies���most were either killed or captured by the Red Army's outer encirclement forces west of the city.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|pp=125���126}} Early in the morning of 2 May, the Soviets captured the [[Reich Chancellery]]. The military historian [[Antony Beevor]] points out that as most of the German combat troops had left the area in the breakouts the night before, the resistance must have been far less than it had been inside the Reichstag.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=388}} General Weidling finally surrendered with his staff at 06:00 hours. He was taken to see General [[Vasily Chuikov]] at 08:23.

There was sporadic fighting in a few isolated buildings where some SS troops still refused to surrender, but the Soviets reduced such buildings to rubble.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=391}}\n==Battle outside Berlin==\nAt some point on 28 April or 29 April, General [[Gotthard Heinrici]], Commander-in-Chief of [[Army Group Vistula]], was relieved of his command after disobeying Hitler's direct orders to hold Berlin at all costs and never order a retreat, and was replaced by General [[Kurt Arthur Benno Student|Kurt Student]].{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=338}} General [[Kurt von Tippelskirch]] was named as Heinrici's interim replacement until Student could arrive and assume control. There remains some confusion as to who was in command, as some references say that Student was captured by the British and never arrived.{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=228}} Regardless of whether von Tippelskirch or Student was in command of Army Group Vistula, the rapidly deteriorating situation that the Germans faced meant that Army Group Vistula coordination of the armies under its nominal command during the last few days of the war was of little significance.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=128}}\nOn the evening of 29 April, Krebs contacted General [[Alfred Jodl]] (Supreme Army Command) by radio:{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=239}} {{quote|text=Request immediate report.

In a 27 January order near the conclusion of the [[Vistula-Oder Offensive]], Marshal Konev supplied a long list of commanders to be reassigned to [[penal battalion]]s for looting, drunkenness, and excesses against civilians {{harv|Duffy|1991|p=275}}.\n&lt;p&gt;\nAlthough all sources agree that rapes occurred, the numbers put forward are estimates.
