It took place on July 30, 1864, between the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]], commanded by [[General (CSA)|General]] [[Robert E. Lee]] and the [[Union Army|Union]] [[Army of the Potomac]], commanded by [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George G. Meade]] (under the direct supervision of the general-in-chief, [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]]).\nAfter weeks of preparation, on July 30, Union forces exploded a mine in Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside|Ambrose E. Burnside's]] [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]] sector, blowing a gap in the Confederate defenses of [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. From this propitious beginning, everything deteriorated rapidly for the Union attackers. Unit after unit charged into and around the crater, where soldiers milled in confusion. Grant considered the assault &quot;the saddest affair I have witnessed in the war.&quot; The Confederates quickly recovered and launched several counterattacks led by Brig. Gen. [[William Mahone]]. The breach was sealed off, and Union forces were repulsed with severe casualties. [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Edward Ferrero]]'s division of black soldiers was badly mauled. This may have been Grant's best chance to end the Siege of Petersburg. Instead, the soldiers settled in for another eight months of trench warfare. Burnside was relieved of command for the last time for his role in the debacle, and he was never again returned to command.&lt;ref name=NPS&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/va070.htm NPS]&lt;/ref&gt;\n==Background==\nDuring the Civil War, [[Petersburg, Virginia]], was an important railhead, where four railroad lines from the south met before continuing to [[Richmond, Virginia]], the capital of the Confederacy.  Most of the supplies to Lee's army and to the city of Richmond funneled through this point. Consequently, the Union regarded it as the &quot;back door&quot; to Richmond, without which defending the Confederate capital would be impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 687.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the [[Siege of Petersburg]] (which was actually trench warfare rather than a true [[siege]]), in which the armies were aligned along a series of fortified positions and trenches more than {{convert|20|mi|km}} long, extending from the old [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]] battlefield near Richmond to areas south of Petersburg.\nAfter Lee held at bay Grant's attempt to seize Petersburg on June 15, the battle settled into a stalemate. Grant had learned a hard lesson at Cold Harbor about attacking Lee in a fortified position and was chafing at the inactivity to which Lee's trenches and forts had confined him. Finally, [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lt. Col.]] [[Henry Pleasants]], commanding the [[48th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment|48th Pennsylvania Infantry]] of Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose E. Burnside]]'s [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]], offered a novel proposal to break the impasse.\nPleasants, a mining engineer from [[Pennsylvania]] in civilian life, proposed digging a long mine shaft underneath the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] lines and planting explosive charges directly underneath a fort (Elliott's Salient) in the middle of the Confederate First Corps line. If successful, this would not only kill all the defenders in the area, it would also open a hole in the Confederate defenses. If enough [[Union Army|Union]] troops filled the breach quickly enough and drove into the Confederate rear area, the Confederates would not be able to muster enough force to drive them out, and Petersburg might fall. Burnside, whose reputation had suffered from his 1862 defeat at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] and his poor performance earlier that year at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]], gave Pleasants the go-ahead.\n===Mine construction===\n[[File:Petersburg crater sketch LOC.jpg|thumb|Contemporary sketch of Col. Pleasants supervising the placement of powder in the mine.]]\nDigging began in late June, but even Grant and Meade saw the operation as, &quot;A mere way to keep the men occupied,&quot; and doubted it of any actual strategic value. They quickly lost interest and Pleasants soon found himself with few materials for his project, to the extent that his men had to forage for wood to support the structure. Work progressed steadily, however. Earth was removed by hand and packed into improvised sledges made from cracker boxes fitted with handles, and the floor, wall, and ceiling of the mine were shored up with timbers from an abandoned wood mill and even from tearing down an old bridge.\nThe shaft was elevated as it moved toward the Confederate lines to make sure moisture did not clog up the mine, and fresh air was drawn in via an ingenious air-exchange mechanism near the entrance. A canvas partition isolated the miners' air supply from outside air (also allowing miners to easily enter and exit the work area). The miners had constructed a vertical exhaust shaft located well behind Union lines. At the vertical shaft's base, a fire was kept continuously burning. A wooden duct ran the entire length of the tunnel and protruded into the outside air. The fire heated stale air inside of the tunnel, drawing it up the exhaust shaft and out of the mine via the [[Stack effect|chimney effect]]. The resulting vacuum then sucked fresh air in from the mine entrance via the wooden duct, which carried it down the length of the tunnel to the location where the miners were working.&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, pp. 36â€“37.&lt;/ref&gt; This precluded the need for additional ventilation shafts that could have been observed by the enemy, and served well in disguising the diggers' progress.\nOn July 17, the main shaft reached under the Confederate position. Rumors of a mine construction soon reached the Confederates, but Lee refused to believe or act upon it for two weeks before commencing countermining attempts, which were sluggish and uncoordinated, and were unable to discover the mine. General [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram]], whose batteries would be above the explosion, did, however, take the threat seriously enough to build a new line of trenches and artillery points behind his position as a precaution.\nThe mine was in a &quot;T&quot; shape. The approach shaft was {{convert|511|ft|m}} long, starting in a sunken area downhill and more than {{convert|50|ft|m}} below the Confederate battery, making detection difficult. The tunnel entrance was narrow, about {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} wide and {{convert|4.5|ft|m}} high. At its end, a perpendicular gallery of {{convert|75|ft|m}} extended in both directions. Grant and Meade suddenly decided to use the mine three days after it was complete after a failed attack known later as the [[First Battle of Deep Bottom]]. Union soldiers filled the mine with 320 kegs of gunpowder, totaling {{convert|8,000|lb|kg}}. The explosives were approximately {{convert|20|ft|m|sigfig=1}} underneath the Confederate works and the T gap was packed shut with {{convert|11|ft|m|0}} of earth in the side galleries and a further {{convert|32|ft|m|0}} of packed earth in the main gallery to prevent the explosion blasting out the mouth of the mine. On July 28, the powder charges were armed.\n===Preparation===\nBurnside had trained a division of [[United States Colored Troops]] (USCT) under Brig. Gen. [[Edward Ferrero]] to lead the assault. The division consisted of two brigades, one designated to go to the left of the crater and the other to the right. A regiment from each brigade was to leave the attack column and extend the breach by rushing perpendicular to the crater, while the remaining regiments were to rush through, seizing the Jerusalem Plank Road just {{convert|1600|ft|m}} beyond, followed by the churchyard and, if possible, Petersburg itself. Burnside's two other divisions, made up of white troops, would then move in, supporting Ferrero's flanks and race for Petersburg itself. Two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) behind the front lines, out of sight of the Confederates, the men of the USCT division were trained for two weeks on the plan.&lt;ref&gt;Trudeau, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;\nDespite this careful planning and intensive training (by Civil War standards), the day before the attack, Meade, who lacked confidence in the operation, ordered Burnside not to use the black troops in the lead assault, claiming that if the attack failed black soldiers would be killed needlessly, creating political repercussions in the North. Meade may have also ordered the change of plans because he lacked confidence in black soldiers' abilities in combat.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, p. 759.&lt;/ref&gt; Burnside protested to General Grant, who sided with Meade. When volunteers were not forthcoming, Burnside selected a replacement white division by having the three commanders draw lots. Brig. Gen. [[James H. Ledlie]]'s 1st Division was selected, but he failed to brief the men on what was expected of them and was reported during the battle to be drunk, well behind the lines, and providing no leadership. (Ledlie would be dismissed for his actions during the battle.)\n==Battle==\n{{Further2|[[Crater Confederate order of battle|Confederate order of battle]] and [[Crater Union order of battle|Union order of battle]]}}\n[[File:Waud-Petersburg-Crater.jpeg|thumb|left|300px|Sketch of the explosion seen from the Union line.]]\nThe plan called for the mine to be detonated between 3:30 and 3:45am on the morning of July 30. Pleasants lit the fuse accordingly, but as with the rest of the mine's provisions, they had been given poor quality fuse, which his men had had to splice themselves. After more and more time passed and no explosion occurred (the impending dawn creating a threat to the men at the staging points, who were in view of the Confederate lines), two volunteers from the 48th Regiment (Lt. Jacob Douty and Sgt. Harry Reese) crawled into the tunnel. After discovering the fuse had burned out at a splice, they spliced on a length of new fuse and relit it.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, at 4:44&amp;nbsp;a.m., the charges exploded in a massive shower of earth, men, and guns. A crater (still visible today) was created, {{convert|170|ft|m}} long, {{convert|100|to|120|ft|m}} wide, and at least {{convert|30|ft|m|sigfig=1}} deep.\nThe explosion immediately killed 278 Confederate soldiers of the 18th and 22nd South Carolina,&lt;ref&gt;Slotkin p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; and stunned Confederate troops did not direct any significant musket or artillery fire at the enemy for at least 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;James, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ledlie's untrained division was not prepared for the explosion, and reports indicate they waited ten minutes before leaving their own entrenchments. Footbridges were supposed to have been placed to allow them to quickly cross their own trenches, but these were missing, meaning the men had to climb in and out of their own trenches just to reach no-man's land.&lt;ref&gt;Catton, ''Stillness at Appomattox'', pp. 243â€“44.&lt;/ref&gt; Once they had wandered to the crater, instead of moving around it as the black troops had been trained to do, they thought it would make an excellent rifle pit and it would be well to take cover. Therefore, they moved down into the crater itself, wasting valuable time while the Confederates, under Brig. Gen. [[William Mahone]], gathered as many troops together as they could for a counterattack. In about an hour's time, they had formed up around the crater and began firing rifles and artillery down into it, in what Mahone later described as a &quot;[[turkey shoot]]&quot;. The plan had failed, but Burnside, instead of cutting his losses, sent in Ferrero's men. Now faced with considerable flanking fire, they also went down into the crater, and for the next few hours, Mahone's soldiers, along with those of Maj. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]] and artillery, slaughtered the IX Corps as it attempted to escape from the crater. Some Union troops eventually advanced and flanked to the right beyond the Crater to the earthworks and assaulted the Confederate lines, driving the Confederates back for several hours in hand-to-hand combat. Mahone's Confederates conducted a sweep out of a sunken gully area about {{convert|200|yd|m}} from the right side of the Union advance. This charge reclaimed the earthworks and drove the Union force back towards the east.\nIn later stages of the battle, many Union casualties were black soldiers killed by Confederate bayonets and musket fire even after surrendering â€“ a direct violation of the [[rules of war]] prevalent at the time (the [[Lieber Code]]).&lt;ref&gt;Robertson and Pegram, pp. 242â€“43.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, black soldiers were also bayoneted by white Union soldiers who feared reprisal from victorious CSA troops.&lt;ref&gt;Slotkin, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Petersburg crater aftermath 1865.jpg|thumb|Crater with Union soldier in 1865.]]\nUnion casualties were 3,798 (504 killed, 1,881 wounded, 1,413 missing or captured), Confederate 1,491 (361 killed, 727 wounded, 403 missing or captured). Many of the Union losses were suffered by Ferrero's division of the USCT.&lt;ref name=casualties/&gt; Both the black and white wounded prisoners were taken to the Confederate hospital at Poplar Lawn in Petersburg. Meade brought charges against Burnside, and a subsequent court of inquiry censured Burnside along with Brig. Gens. Ledlie, Ferrero, [[Orlando B. Willcox]], and Col. [[Zenas Bliss|Zenas R. Bliss]]. Burnside was never again assigned to duty. Although he was as responsible for the defeat as Burnside, Meade escaped immediate censure. However, in early 1865, the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War|Congressional Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]] exonerated Burnside and condemned Meade for changing the plan of attack (which did little good for Burnside, whose reputation was ruined).&lt;ref&gt;Horn, pp. 118â€“19.&lt;/ref&gt; As for Mahone, the victory, won largely due to his efforts in supporting Johnson's stunned men, earned him a lasting reputation as one of the best young generals of Lee's army in the war's last year.\nGrant wrote to Chief of Staff [[Henry W. Halleck]], &quot;It was the saddest affair I have witnessed in this war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 723.&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated to Halleck that &quot;Such an opportunity for carrying fortifications I have never seen and do not expect again to have.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Catton, ''Grant Takes Command'', p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;\nPleasants, who had no role in the battle itself, received praise for his idea and the execution thereof. When he was appointed a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] brigadier general on March 13, 1865, the citation made explicit mention of his role.\nGrant subsequently gave in his evidence before the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War|Committee on the Conduct of the War]]:\n{{Quote|General Burnside wanted to put his colored division in front, and I believe if he had done so it would have been a success. Still I agreed with General Meade as to his objections to that plan. General Meade said that if we put the colored troops in front (we had only one division) and it should prove a failure, it would then be said and very properly, that we were shoving these people ahead to get killed because we did not care anything about them. But that could not be said if we put white troops in front.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson/Buel, vol. 4, p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt;}}\nDespite the battle being a tactical Confederate victory, the strategic situation in the Eastern Theater remained unchanged. Both sides remained in their trenches and the siege continued.\n[[File:Battleofthecrater.jpg|thumb|The Crater in 2004.]]\n==Historical site==\nThe area of the Battle of the Crater is a frequently visited portion of [[Petersburg National Battlefield Park]]. The mine entrance is open for inspection annually on the anniversary of the battle. There are sunken areas where air shafts and cave-ins extend up to the &quot;T&quot; shape near the end. The park includes many other sites, primarily those that were a portion of the Union lines around Petersburg.\n[[File:crater mine entrance.jpg|thumb|Mine entrance in 2006]]\n==In popular culture==\n* The Battle of the Crater was graphically portrayed in the opening scenes of the 2003 film ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'' starring [[Jude Law]] as a Confederate soldier.  The film inaccurately depicts the giant explosion occurring in broad daylight although it actually happened in darkness at 4:44&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2004-01-19-cold-mountain_x.htm &quot;Walking tour recounts Civil War battle in 'Cold Mountain' &quot;].
