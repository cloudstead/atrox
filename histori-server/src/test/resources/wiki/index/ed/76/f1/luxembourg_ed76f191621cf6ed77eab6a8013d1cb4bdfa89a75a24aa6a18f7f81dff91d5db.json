It lies between latitudes [[49th parallel north|49°]] and [[51st parallel north|51° N]], and longitudes [[5th meridian east|5°]] and [[7th meridian east|7° E]].\nTo the east, Luxembourg borders the [[Germany|German]] ''[[States of Germany|Bundesland]]'' of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[Saarland]], and, to the south, it borders the [[France|French]] ''[[Région in France|région]]'' of [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]. The Grand Duchy borders the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]], in particular the latter's [[Provinces of regions in Belgium|provinces]] of [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Luxembourg]] and [[Liège (province)|Liège]], part of which comprises the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], to the west and to the north respectively.\nThe northern third of the country is known as the '[[Oesling]]', and forms part of the [[Ardennes]]. It is dominated by hills and low mountains, including the [[Kneiff]] near Wilwerdange,&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20070610225858 |url=http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/publications/horizontales/recueil_communes/recueil_pdf.pdf |title=Mountains in Luxembourg }}, recueil de statistiques par commune. statistiques.public.lu (2003) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; which is the highest point, at 560 metres (1,837&amp;nbsp;ft). Other mountains are the 'Buurgplaaz' at 559 metres near Huldange and the 'Napoléonsgaard' at 554 metres near Rambrouch. The region is sparsely populated, with only one town ([[Wiltz]]) with a population of more than four thousand people.\n[[File:Clerve Alscheid.jpg|thumb|left|Countryside of [[Alscheid]].]]\nThe southern two-thirds of the country is called the &quot;[[Gutland (Luxembourg)|Gutland]]&quot;, and is more densely populated than the Oesling. It is also more diverse, and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions. The [[Luxembourg plateau]], in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, [[sandstone]] formation, and the site of the city of Luxembourg. [[Little Switzerland (Luxembourg)|Little Switzerland]], in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests. The [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] valley is the lowest-lying region, running along the southeastern border. The [[Red Lands]], in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg's industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg's largest towns.\nThe border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three [[river]]s: the Moselle, the [[Sauer]], and the [[Our River|Our]]. Other major rivers are the [[Alzette]], the [[Attert River|Attert]], the [[Clerve]], and the [[Wiltz River|Wiltz]]. The [[valley]]s of the mid-Sauer and Attert form the border between the Gutland and the Oesling.\nAccording to the 2012 Environmental Performance Index, Luxembourg is one of the world's best performers in environmental protection, ranking 4th out of 132 assessed countries&lt;ref&gt;[http://epi.yale.edu/epi2012/rankings ] {{wayback|url=http://epi.yale.edu/epi2012/rankings |date=20131229150624 |df=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Luxembourg also ranks 6th among the top ten most livable cities in the world by Mercer's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyork-cg.mae.lu/en/News/Luxembourg-City-in-the-top-10-of-the-most-livable-cities]&lt;/ref&gt;\n===Climate===\nLuxembourg has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Cfb), marked by high [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], particularly in late summer.
