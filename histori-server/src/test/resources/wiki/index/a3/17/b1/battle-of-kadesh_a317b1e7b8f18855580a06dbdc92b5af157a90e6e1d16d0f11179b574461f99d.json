[[Thutmose I]], [[Thutmose III]] and his son and coregent [[Amenhotep II]] fought [[Battle of Megiddo (15th century BC)|battle]]s from [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] north to the Orontes River, including conflict with Kadesh.{{Citation needed|date = December 2012}}\nMany of the Egyptian campaign accounts between c. 1400 and 1300 BC reflect the general destabilization of the region of the [[Djahi]]. The reigns of [[Thutmose IV]] and [[Amenhotep III]] were undistinguished, except that Egypt continued to lose territory to [[Mitanni]] in northern Syria.{{Citation needed|date = December 2012}}\nDuring the late [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Egyptian 18th dynasty]], the [[Amarna Letters]]&lt;ref&gt;Moran, William L., &quot;The Amarna Letters&quot;, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; tell the story of the decline of Egyptian influence in the region. The Egyptians showed flagging interest here until almost the end of the dynasty. [[Horemheb]], the last ruler of this dynasty, campaigned in this region, finally beginning to turn Egyptian interest back to this region.{{Citation needed|date = December 2012}}\nThis process continued in the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th Dynasty]]. Like his father [[Ramesses I]], [[Seti I]] was a military commander and set out to restore Egypt's empire to the days of the Tuthmosis kings almost a century before.

He made an informal peace with the [[Hittites]], took control of coastal areas along the [[Mediterranean]], and continued to campaign in Canaan. A second campaign led him to capture Kadesh (where a stela commemorated his victory) and [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]]. His son and heir Ramesses II campaigned with him. Historical records exist which record a large weapons order by Ramesses II the year prior to the expedition he led to Kadesh in his fifth regnal year.{{Citation needed|date = December 2012}}\nHowever, at some point, both regions may have lapsed back into Hittite control. What exactly happened to Amurru is disputed. The Hittitologist [[Trevor R. Bryce|Trevor Bryce]] suggests that, although it may have fallen once again under Hittite control, it is more likely Amurru remained a Hittite vassal state.&lt;ref name =&quot;Bryce&quot;&gt;Bryce, Trevor, The Kingdom of the Hittites, Oxford University Press, new edition 2005, ISBN 0-19-927908-X, p.233&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe immediate antecedents to the Battle of Kadesh were the [[Ramesses II#First Syrian campaign|early campaigns]] of Ramesses II into Canaan. In the fourth year of his reign, he marched north into Syria, either to recapture Amurru&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Nicolas, ''A History of Ancient Egypt'' (1994) pp. 253ff.&lt;/ref&gt; or, as a probing effort, to confirm his vassals' loyalty and explore the terrain of possible battles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryce&quot;/&gt; The recovery of Amurru was Muwatalli's stated motivation for marching south to confront the Egyptians.

Also significant was the presence of [[Sherden]] troops among the [[Military history of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian army]].  This is the first time they appear as Egyptian mercenaries, and they would play an increasingly significant role in [[Bronze age#Ancient near east|Late Bronze Age]] history, ultimately appearing among the [[Sea Peoples]] that ravaged the east Mediterranean at the end of the [[Bronze Age]]. Healy in ''Armies of the Pharaohs'' observes:\n:&quot;It is not possible to be precise about the size of the Egyptian chariot force at [[Kadesh]] though it could not have numbered less than 2,000 vehicles spread though the corps of Amun, P'Re, Ptah and Sutekh, assuming that approx. 500 machines were allocated to each [[corps]]. To this we may need to add those of the Ne'arin, for if they were not native Egyptian troops their number may not have been formed from chariots detached from the army corps.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Healy, Armies of the Pharaohs, Osprey Publishing, 2000. p.39&lt;/ref&gt;\nOn the Hittite side, [[Ramesses II]] recorded a long [[#Hittite allies|list of nineteen Hittite allies]] brought to [[Kadesh]] by Muwatalli.\nThis list is of considerable interest to Hittitologists as it reflects the extent of Hittite influence at the time.\n===Battle===\nRamesses II describes his arrival on the battlefield in the two principal inscriptions he wrote concerning the battle, the so-called &quot;Poem&quot; and the &quot;Bulletin&quot;:\n{{cquote|(From the &quot;Poem&quot;) Now then, his majesty had prepared his infantry, his chariotry, and the [[Sherden]] of his majesty's capturing,...in the Year 5, 2nd month of the third season, day 9, his majesty passed the fortress of [[Tjaru|Sile]].

He increased the distance between his [[Amun]] Division and the remaining [[Ra|Re]], [[Ptah]] and [[Seth]] divisions, thereby splitting up his combined forces. When they were attacked by the Hittites, Ramesses II complained of the failure of his officials to dispatch scouts to discover the true location of the Hittites and report their location to him.&lt;ref\nname=&quot;Santosuosso&quot;&gt;Santosuosso, Antonio, &quot;Kadesh Revisited: Reconstructing the Battle Between the Egyptians and the Hittites &quot; ''The Journal of Military History'', Vol 60 no. 3, July 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The pharaoh quickly sent urgent messengers to hasten the arrival of the Ptah and Seth divisions of his army, which were still some distance away on the far side of the River Orontes. Before Ramesses could organize his troops, however, Muwatalli's chariots attacked the Re division, which was caught in the open and almost destroyed. Some of its survivors fled to the safety of the Amun camp, but they were pursued by the Hittite forces.{{Citation needed|date = December 2012}}\nThe Hittite chariotry crashed through the Amun camp's shield wall and began their assault. This created panic among the Amun troops as well. However, the momentum of the Hittite attack was already starting to wane, as the impending obstacles of such a large camp forced many Hittite charioteers to slow their attack; some were killed in chariot crashes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Healy, op. cit., p.61&quot;&gt;Mark Healy, op. cit., p.61&lt;/ref&gt; In the Egyptian account of the battle, Ramesses describes himself as being deserted and surrounded by enemies:\n&quot;''...No officer was with me, no charioteer, no soldier of the army, no shield-bearer ...''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Egyptian Literature|volume=II:The New Kingdom|pages=65|year=1976|first=Miriam|last=Lichtheim|location=Berkeley|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;\nOnly with help from the gods did [[Ramesses II]] personally defeat his attackers and return to the Egyptian lines:\n&quot;''...I was before them like [[Set (mythology)|Set]] in his moment.

Ramesses' action was successful in driving the Hittites back towards the [[Orontes river|Orontes]] and away from the Egyptian camp,&lt;ref&gt;Mark Healy, p.62&lt;/ref&gt; while in the ensuing pursuit, the heavier Hittite chariots were easily overtaken and dispatched by the lighter, faster, Egyptian chariots.{{Citation needed|date = December 2012}}\n[[Image:Battle of Kadesh III.png|thumb|350px|final phase of the battle.]]\nAlthough he had suffered a significant reversal, [[Muwatalli II|Muwatalli]] still commanded a large force of reserve chariotry and infantry plus the walls of the town. As the retreat reached the river, he ordered another thousand chariots to attack the Egyptians, the stiffening element consisting of the high nobles who surrounded the king. As the Hittite forces approached the Egyptian camp again, the Ne'arin troop contingent from [[Amorite|Amurru]] suddenly arrived, this time surprising the Hittites.

The new lighter, faster, two-man Egyptian chariots were able to pursue and take down the slower three-man Hittite chariots from behind as they overtook them. The leading elements of Hittites' retreating chariots were thus pinned against the river and in several hieroglyphic inscriptions related to Ramesses II, said to flee across the river, abandoning their chariots, &quot;swimming as fast as any crocodile&quot; in their flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;HC080514-rpt&quot;/&gt;\nHittite records from [[Boghazkoy]], however, tell of a very different conclusion to the greater campaign, where a chastened Ramesses was forced to depart from Kadesh in defeat.

His victory proved to be ephemeral, however. The thin strip of territory pinched between Amurru and Kadesh did not make for a stable possession. Within a year, they had returned to the Hittite fold, which meant that Ramesses had to march against [[Siege of Dapur|Dapur]] once more in his tenth year.

An Egyptian version survives on a [[papyrus]].{{Citation needed|date = December 2012}}\n==Documentation==\nAlthough there is more evidence in the form of texts and wall reliefs for this battle than for any other battle in the [[Ancient Near East]], almost all of it is from an Egyptian perspective, and indeed the first scholarly report on the battle, by [[James Henry Breasted]] in 1903, praised these sources which allowed the reconstruction the battle with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Henry Breasted]], '' A History of the Ancient Egyptians'' (1908) [http://www.zemlja2.webspace.virginmedia.com/history/kadesh-brested.html#305 sect. 305]&lt;/ref&gt; However, some historians argue that the battle was a draw at best, and that Egyptian influence over Amurru and Qadesh seems to have been lost forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Mieroop|first=Marc Van|title=A History of Ancient Egypt|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=9781405160704|pages=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe main source of information is in the Egyptian record of the battle, for which a general level of accuracy is assumed despite factual errors and propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;TG James, ''Pharaoh's People: Scenes from Life in Imperial Egypt'', 2007.  James says 'This romanticized record of the Battle of Qadesh cannot be treated as a truthful account of what happened, and I doubt whether many ancient Egyptians would have accepted it wholly as an historical record' (page 26). He notes however that the 'broad facts' are 'probably reported with a fair degree of accuracy' (page 27).&lt;/ref&gt; The bombastic nature of Ramesses' version has long been recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the harshest criticism of Ramesses has come from Egyptologists.  &quot;It is all too clear that he was a stupid and culpably inefficient general and that he failed to gain his objectives at Kadesh&quot; (John A. Wilson, ''The Culture of Ancient Egypt'' (1951) p. 247.  Although Wilson does recognize the personal bravery of Ramesses, and the improvement of his skills in subsequent campaigns.)&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian version of the battle of Kadesh is recorded in two primary forms, known as the ''Poem'' and the ''Bulletin''.  The ''Poem'' has been questioned as actual verse, as opposed to a prose account similar to what other pharaohs had recorded.  Similarly, the ''Bulletin'' is itself simply a lengthy caption accompanying the reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Alan, ''The Kadesh Inscriptions of Ramesses II'' (1975) pp.2–4.  However, Miriam Lichtheim, ''Ancient Egyptian Literature, Vol. 2: The New Kingdom'' (1978) p. 58, maintains that the ''Poem'' is truly just that, contra Gardiner, and prefers to maintain the older tripartite division of the documentation.&lt;/ref&gt;  These inscriptions are repeated multiple times (seven for the ''Bulletin'' and eight for the ''Poem'', in temples in [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], [[Temple of Luxor]], [[Karnak]], [[Abu Simbel]] and the [[Ramesseum]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Egyptian Literature|volume=II:The New Kingdom|pages=57|year=1976|first=Miriam|last=Lichtheim|location=Berkeley|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn addition to these lengthy presentations, there are also numerous small captions used to point out various elements of the battle.  Outside of the inscriptions, there are textual occurrences preserved in ''Papyrus Raifet'' and ''Papyrus Sallier III'',&lt;ref&gt;Breasted, James Henry, ''Ancient Records of Egypt: Historical Documents&quot; (1906) p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and a rendering of these same events in a letter from Ramesses to Hattusili III written in response to a scoffing complaint by Hattusili about the pharaoh's victorious depiction of the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, Kenneth A., ''Ramesside Inscriptions, Notes and Comments Volume II'' (1999) pp. 13ff.&lt;/ref&gt;\nHittite references to the battle, including the above letter, have been found at [[Hattusa]], although no annals have been discovered that might describe it as part of a campaign. Instead, there are various references made to it in the context of other events.  This is especially true of Hattusili III, for whom the battle marked an important milestone in his career.{{Citation needed|date = December 2012}}\n===Hittite allies===\nSources:  Goetze, A., &quot;The Hittites and Syria (1300–1200 B.C.)&quot;, in ''Cambridge Ancient History'' (1975) p.&amp;nbsp;253; Gardiner, Alan, ''The Kadesh Inscriptions of Ramesses II'' (1975) pp.&amp;nbsp;57ff.; Breasted, James Henry, ''Ancient Records of Egypt; Historical Records'' (1906) pp.&amp;nbsp;125ff.; Lichtheim, Mirian, ''Ancient Egyptian Literature, Vol. 2: The New Kingdom'' (1978) pp.&amp;nbsp;57ff.\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;\n|-\n!
