A [[Army of the North (France)|French army]] under the command of [[Napoleon]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: an [[British Army|Anglo]]-allied army under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], and a [[Prussia]]n army under the command of [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher]].\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilize armies. Wellington and Blücher's armies were [[canton (military)|canton]]ed close to the north-eastern border of France. Napoleon chose to attack them in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. Waterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was &quot;the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;  The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]], and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile. [[Abdication of Napoleon (1815)|Napoleon abdicated]] 4 days later, and on the 7 July coalition forces entered Paris.\nAfter the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] Wellington withdrew from [[Waterloo Campaign: Quatre Bras to Waterloo|Quatre Bras to Waterloo]]. After the simultaneous [[Battle of Ligny]] the [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|Prussians withdrew parallel to Wellington]], drawing a third part of Napoleon's forces away from Waterloo to the separate and simultaneous [[Battle of Wavre]]. Upon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] [[escarpment]], across the Brussels road. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians. In the evening Napoleon committed his last reserves to a desperate final attack, which was narrowly beaten back. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank Wellington's Anglo-allied army counter-attacked in the center, and the French army was routed.\nThe battlefield is located in the municipalities of [[Braine-l'Alleud]] and [[Lasne]],{{sfn|Marcelis|2015}} about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]]. The site of the battlefield today is dominated by a large monument, the [[Lion's Mound]]. As this mound was constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself, the contemporary topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved.\n==Prelude==\n{{Main|Waterloo Campaign}}\n[[File:Strategic Situation of Western Europe 1815.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The strategic situation in Western Europe in 1815: 250,000 Frenchmen faced a coalition of about 850,000 soldiers on four [[Front (military)|fronts]]. Napoleon was forced to leave 20,000 men in Western France to reduce a royalist insurrection.]]\nOn 13 March 1815, six days before Napoleon reached Paris, the powers at the [[Congress of Vienna]] [[s:Declaration at the Congress of Vienna|declared him an outlaw]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/napoleon/time7.html Timeline: The Congress of Vienna, the Hundred Days, and Napoleon's Exile on St Helena], Center of Digital Initiatives, [[Brown University]] Library&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] mobilised armies to defeat Napoleon.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|p=59}} Critically outnumbered, Napoleon knew that once his attempts at dissuading one or more of the [[Seventh Coalition]] allies from invading France had failed, his only chance of remaining in power was to attack before the coalition mobilised.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}\nIf Napoleon could destroy the existing coalition forces south of Brussels before they were reinforced, he might be able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war and then turn his armies towards the Austrians and Russians. An additional consideration was that there were many French-speaking sympathisers in Belgium and a French victory might trigger a friendly revolution there. Also, the British troops in Belgium were largely second-line troops; most of the veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] had been sent to North America to fight in the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|A map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n[[File:Napoleon crop.jpg|thumb|upright|The resurgent [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] strategy was to isolate the Allied and Prussian armies and annihilate each one separately]]\n[[File:NapoleonsHeadquartersAtWaterloo.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's headquarters on the eve of the battle, the Caillou (&quot;Pebble&quot;) Farm]]\n[[File:Marechal Ney.jpg|thumb|right|Marshal [[Michel Ney]] exercised tactical control of the greater part of the French forces for most of the battle]]\nWellington's initial dispositions were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through [[Mons]] to the south-west of Brussels.{{sfn|Siborne&lt;!--W--&gt;|1990|p=82}} This would have cut Wellington's communications with his base at [[Ostend]], but would have pushed his army closer to Blücher's. Napoleon manipulated Wellington's fear of this loss of his supply chain from the channel ports with false intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|2005|pp= 136–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;\nBy June, Napoleon had raised a total army strength of about 300,000 men. The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but they were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Herold|1967|pp= 53, 58, 110.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He divided his army into a left wing commanded by [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]], a right wing commanded by [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]] and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another). Crossing the frontier near [[Charleroi]] before dawn on 15 June, the French [[Waterloo Campaign: Start of hostilities (15 June)|rapidly overran Coalition outposts]], securing Napoleon's &quot;central position&quot; between Wellington's and Blücher's armies.\nOnly very late on the night of 15 June, was Wellington certain that the Charleroi attack was the main French thrust. In the early hours of 16 June, at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on [[Quatre Bras]], where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of [[Bernhard Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]], was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ney's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that, if necessary, he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon.\nNapoleon moved against the concentrated Prussian army first. On 16 June, with a part of the reserve and the right wing of the army, he attacked and defeated Blücher's Prussians at the [[Battle of Ligny]]. The Prussian centre gave way under more heavy French assaults but the flanks held their ground. Ney, meanwhile, found the crossroads of [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who were defeated at the Battle of Ligny on the same day. The Prussian defeat made Wellington's position at Quatre Bras untenable, so the next day he withdrew northwards, to a defensive position he had [[reconnaissance|reconnoitred]] the previous year—the low [[ridge]] of Mont-Saint-Jean, south of the village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] and the [[Sonian Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=527}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|The Prussian retreat from Ligny]] went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the French.&lt;ref name=Chesney-136&gt;{{Harvnb|Chesney|1907|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of their rearguard units held their positions until about midnight and some elements did not move out until the following morning, ignored by the French.&lt;ref name=Chesney-136 /&gt; Crucially, the Prussians did not retreat to the east, along their own lines of communication. Instead, they too fell back northwards—parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow|Bülow's]] IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of [[Wavre]].&lt;ref name=Chesney-136 /&gt;\nOnce he had intelligence of the Prussian defeat, Wellington organised a retreat from [[Waterloo Campaign: Quatre Bras to Waterloo|Quatre Bras to Waterloo]]. Napoleon, with the reserves, made a late start on 17 June and joined Ney at Quatre Bras at 13:00 to attack Wellington's army but found the position empty. The French pursued Wellington's retreating army all the way to Waterloo, however due to weather and the head start that Napoleon's tardy advance had allowed Wellington, apart from a cavalry [[action at Genappe]] there was no other substantial engagement.\nBefore leaving Ligny, Napoleon ordered Grouchy, commander of the right wing, to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|follow up the retreating Prussians]] with 33,000 men. A late start, uncertainty about the direction the Prussians had taken and the vagueness of the orders given to him meant that Grouchy was too late to prevent the Prussian army reaching Wavre, from where it could march to support Wellington. By the end of 17 June, Wellington's army had arrived at its position at Waterloo, with the main body of Napoleon's army following. Blücher's army was gathering in and around Wavre, around {{convert|8|mi|km}} to the east of the city.\n==Armies==\n[[File:Lord Arthur Wellesley the Duke of Wellington.jpg|thumb|The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], a veteran general of the [[Peninsular War]], commanded an army of British, Dutch, and German forces.]]\n{{Main|Order of Battle of the Waterloo Campaign}}\nThree armies were involved in the battle: Napoleon's ''Armée du Nord''; a multinational army under Wellington; and a Prussian army under Blücher.\nThe French army of around 69,000 consisted of 48,000 infantry, 14,000 cavalry, and 7,000 artillery with 250 guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=68}} gives 73,000.&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon had used conscription to fill the ranks of the French army throughout his rule, but he did not conscript men for the 1815 campaign. His troops were mainly veterans with considerable experience and a fierce devotion to their Emperor.{{sfn|Glover|2014|page=30}} The cavalry in particular was both numerous and formidable, and included fourteen regiments of armoured [[heavy cavalry]] and seven of highly versatile [[lancers]].\nWellington claimed that he himself had &quot;an infamous army, very weak and ill-equipped, and a very inexperienced Staff&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=485}}&lt;/ref&gt; His troops consisted of 67,000 men: 50,000 infantry, 11,000 cavalry, and 6,000 artillery with 150 guns. Of these, 25,000 were British (including a disproportionate number of Irishmen&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.maynoothuniversity.ie/3099/1/Thesis_-_'Ireland_and_the_Waterloo_campaign_of_1815'.pdf Peter Molloy, &quot;Ireland and the Waterloo campaign of 1815&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;), with another 6,000 from the [[King's German Legion]] (KGL). All of the [[British Army]] troops were regular soldiers but only 7,000 of them were [[Peninsular War]] veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=484}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there were 17,000 Dutch and Belgian troops, 11,000 from [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], 6,000 from [[Brunswick-Lüneburg#Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Brunswick]], and 3,000 from [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbero 2005 75–76&quot; /&gt;\n[[File:YoungwilliamII.jpg|thumb|180px|[[William II of the Netherlands|William, Prince of Orange]], commander of the Anglo-allied [[Order of Battle of the Waterloo Campaign#I Corps 2|I Corps]].]]\nMany of the troops in the Coalition armies were inexperienced.{{efn|An artillery captain, Mercer, thought the Brunswickers &quot;perfect children&quot; {{Harv|Mercer|1870|loc=}}.}}{{efn|On 13 June, the commandant at [[Ath]] requested powder and cartridges as members of a Hanoverian reserve regiment there had never yet fired a shot {{Harv|Longford|1971|p=486}}.}} The Dutch army had been re-established in 1815, following the earlier defeat of Napoleon. With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian Barbero states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and ''foreign'' troops did not prove significant under fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2006|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\nWellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were not recalled to participate in the battle but were to serve as a fallback position should the battle be lost. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange's]] younger brother [[Prince Frederik of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239-240}} According to Hofschröer, the best Dutch troops were at Halle and he questions the reasons for their placement.{{sfn|Hofschröer|1999|p=65}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813–1814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|2005|p=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance&amp;nbsp;– guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschröer|2005|pp=60–62}}\nOff-setting these handicaps the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle at 24 hours notice.{{sfn|Hofschröer|2005|pp=60–62}}\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.{{sfn|Hofschröer|2005|pp=60–62}} Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo&amp;nbsp;– two brigades under Bülow, commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl von Zieten|Zieten's]] I Corps and parts of [[Pirch I|Pirch I's]] II Corps engaged at about 18:00.\n==Battlefield==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Belgium-6773 - Battlefield View (14152126362).jpg|thumb|400px|A view of the battlefield from the Lion's mound. On the top right are the buildings of [[La Haye Sainte]].]]\nThe Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east-west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78–79}}\nUsing the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his skirmishers and artillery.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78–79}} The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|km}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:Waterloo.1816.02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A map showing the local geography, with Waterloo defending the approach to [[Brussels]], 1816.]]\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the château, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as &quot;the hollow-way&quot;) along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of Papelotte.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbero 2005 149&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\nBoth Hougoumont and [[Papelotte]] were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the [[King's German Legion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbero 2005 149&quot;/&gt;\nOn the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parry|1900|p=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\nThis position presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=141,235}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honoré Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=83–85}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|thumb|1000px|center|A panorama of the Waterloo battlefield in 2012.]]\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Blücher (nach Gebauer).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher]], who had led one of the coalition armies defeating Napoleon at the [[Battle of Leipzig]], commanded the Prussian army]]\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Blücher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Blücher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Blücher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Blücher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Blücher, promising to support him with three corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|pp=535,536}}&lt;/ref&gt;\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under Bülow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the [[Battle of Ligny]]. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and Bülow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&amp;nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along Bülow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. Bülow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, &quot;Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=547}}&lt;/ref&gt;\nNapoleon's surprisingly dismissive statements should not be taken at face value, given the Emperor's maxim that &quot;in war, morale is everything&quot; and that praising the enemy is always wrong, as it reduces one's morale. Indeed, he had been seen engaging in such pre-battle, morale-boosting harangues on a number of occasions in the past and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo he had to deal with his chief of staff's pessimism and nervousness and had to respond to several persistent and almost defeatist objections from some of his senior generals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2001|pp=163–166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\nLater on, being told by his brother, [[Jérôme Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Blücher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]]]\nNapoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to &quot;head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]&quot; and then &quot;push before him&quot; the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=548}}&lt;/ref&gt;\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292,293}}&lt;/ref&gt; To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&amp;pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=95–98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\n===Hougoumont===\n{{Main|Hougoumont}}\n[[File:Andrieux - La bataille de Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|''The Battle of Waterloo'' by [[Clément-Auguste Andrieux]] (1852)]]\nThe historian Andrew Roberts notes that &quot;It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at &quot;about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wellesley|1815|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources state that the attack began around 11:30.{{efn|&quot;The hour at which Waterloo began, though there were 150,000&amp;nbsp;actors in the great tragedy, was long a matter of dispute.

He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve&quot; {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. &quot;...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree...

Assuming an officer had set his watch at noon and then meticulously wound it twice a day but not reset it during the approach march, by the time the two corps reached the vicinity of Waterloo, the I Corps officer's watch would have read 12:40 p.m. at a time when the IV Corps officer's read 11:20 a.m., and it was noon at Waterloo.

Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,{{efn|Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.}} resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st Foot]], a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by [[Hugh Halkett|Hugh Halkett's]] 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille.

Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21&amp;nbsp;battalions (12,000&amp;nbsp;troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings. He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=305,306}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and later stated that &quot;the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n===First French infantry attack===\n[[File:Battle of Waterloo.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the battle.

Though some projectiles buried themselves in the soft soil, most found their marks on the reverse slope of the ridge. The bombardment forced the cavalry of the Union Brigade (in third line) to move to its left, as did the Scots Greys, to reduce their casualty rate.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|p=287}}\nAt about 13:00, Napoleon saw the first columns of Prussians around the village of [[Lasne-Chapelle-Saint-Lambert]], four or five miles (three hours march for an army) away from his right flank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon's reaction was to have Marshal Soult send a message to Grouchy telling him to come towards the battlefield and attack the arriving Prussians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Grouchy, however, had been executing Napoleon's previous orders to follow the Prussians &quot;with your sword against his back&quot; towards Wavre, and was by then too far away to reach Waterloo. Grouchy was advised by his subordinate, [[Étienne Maurice Gérard|Gérard]], to &quot;march to the sound of the guns&quot;, but stuck to his orders and engaged the Prussian III Corps rear guard under the command of [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Baron]] [[Johann von Thielmann]] at the [[Battle of Wavre]]. Moreover, Soult's letter ordering Grouchy to move quickly to join Napoleon and attack Bülow would not actually reach Grouchy until after 20:00.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}\nA little after 13:00, I Corps' attack began. D'Erlon, like Ney, had encountered Wellington in Spain, and was aware of the British commander's favoured tactic of using massed short-range musketry to drive off infantry columns. Rather than use the usual nine-deep French columns deployed abreast of one another, therefore, each division advanced in closely spaced battalion lines behind one another. This allowed them to concentrate their fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not leave room for them to change formation.\nThe formation was initially effective. Its leftmost division, under [[François-Xavier Donzelot]], advanced on La Haye Sainte. The farmhouse was defended by the [[King's German Legion]]. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out to either side and, with the support of several squadrons of [[cuirassiers]], succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The Prince of Orange saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian Lüneberg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=289–293}}\nAt about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000&amp;nbsp;men over a front of about {{convert|1,000|m|yd|abbr=off}}, against Wellington's left wing. At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000&amp;nbsp;men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st &quot;[[Brigade van Bylandt]]&quot; of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under [[Sir Thomas Picton]], who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras. In addition, the Bijlandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope.

Van Zuylen rallied 400 men, according to his estimate, who were ready to join the counterattack and even captured two French fanions ({{Harvnb|Bas|1909|pp=338–341}}(vol. 3); {{Harvnb|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=293–295}}).}} A moment later the Prince of Orange ordered a counterattack, which actually occurred around 10 minutes later.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt's]] brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, [[François-Xavier Donzelot|Donzelot's]] division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e Régiment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e Régiment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack's]] 9th Brigade consisting of three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], the 92nd Gordons and the [[44th Foot]] totaling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134–138}}\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296–297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=138}}\n===Charge of the British heavy cavalry===\n{{quote|Our officers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything.

Squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle – a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than {{convert|60|ft|m}} in length on a side. Vulnerable to artillery or infantry, squares that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry, because they could not be outflanked and because horses would not charge into a hedge of bayonets.

On they came until they got near enough, whilst the very earth seemed to vibrate beneath the thundering tramp of the mounted host. One might suppose that nothing could have resisted the shock of this terrible moving mass. They were the famous cuirassiers, almost all old soldiers, who had distinguished themselves on most of the battlefields of Europe. In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''&quot;Vive l'Empereur!&quot;'' The word of command, &quot;Prepare to receive cavalry&quot;, had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards|&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gronow|1862|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|&quot;The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses.&quot; (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]])]]\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weller|1992|pp=211,212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive.

If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavalié Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect:&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part. Wellington himself sought refuge in the &quot;shaky&quot; Brunswick squares at the time and observed what he interpreted as acts of cowardice by British artillerymen, who &quot;...&amp;nbsp;ran off the field entirely, taking with them limbers, ammunition, and everything&amp;nbsp;...&quot; as he wrote in a letter of 21 December 1815 to the Master-General of the Ordnance, Lord Mulgrave. The incident even justified the denial of pensions to members of the Artillery Corps in his view. So, where Mercer claimed heroism, Wellington saw the opposite.

Zieten had by this time brought up his 1st Brigade, but had become concerned at the sight of stragglers and casualties from the Nassau units on Wellington's left and from the Prussian 15th Brigade. These troops appeared to be withdrawing and Zieten, fearing that his own troops would be caught up in a general retreat, was starting to move away from Wellington's flank and towards the Prussian main body near Plancenoit. Zieten had also received a direct order from Blücher to support Bülow, Zieten obeyed and marched to Bülow's aid. Müffling saw this movement away and persuaded Zieten to support Wellington's left flank.

This attack, mounted at around 19:30, was intended to break through Wellington's centre and roll up his line away from the Prussians. Although it is one of the most celebrated passages of arms in military history, it had been unclear which units actually participated. It appears that it was mounted by five battalions of the Middle Guard,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Two chasseur battalions of the 4th Chasseurs were merged into one on the day of the battle, so while five Imperial Guard formations went forward, they may have comprised six battalions {{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|loc={{Page needed|date=May 2010}}}}.

The Middle Guard formed in battalion squares, each about 550 men strong, with the 1st/3rd Grenadiers, led by Generals [[Louis Friant|Friant]] and [[Paul-Jean-Baptiste Poret de Morvan|Poret de Morvan]], on the right along the road, to their left and rear was General Harlet leading the square of the 4th Grenadiers, then the 1st/3rd Chasseurs under General [[Claude-Etienne Michel|Michel]], next the 2nd/3rd Chasseurs and finally the large single square of two battalions of 800 soldiers of the 4th Chasseurs led by General Henrion. Two batteries of Imperial Guard Horse Artillery accompanied them with sections of two guns between the squares. Each square was led  by a general and Marshal Ney, mounted on his 5th horse of the day, led the advance.{{sfn|Field|2013|pp=191-192}}\nBehind them, in reserve, were the three battalions of the Old Guard, right to left 1st/2nd Grenadiers, 2nd/2nd Chasseurs and 1st/2nd Chasseurs. Napoleon left Ney to conduct the assault, however Ney led the Middle Guard on an oblique towards the Allied centre right instead of attacking straight up the centre, Napoleon would send Ney's senior ADC Colonel Crabbé to order Ney to adjust. But Crabbé was unable to get there in time. Other troops rallied to support the advance of the Guard. On the left infantry from Reille's corps that was not engaged with Hougoumont and cavalry advanced. On the right all the now rallied elements of D'Érlon's corps once again ascended the  ridge and engaged the allied line. Of these, Pégot's brigade broke into skirmish order and moved north and west of La Haye Sainte and provided fire support to Ney, once again unhorsed, and Friant's 1st/3rd Grenadiers. The Guards first received fire from some Brunswick battalions, but the return fire of the grenadiers forced them to retire. Next, Colin Halket's brigade front line consisting of the 30th Foot and 73rd traded fire but they were driven back in confusion into the 33rd and 69th regiments, Halket was shot in the face and seriously wounded and the whole brigade retreated in a mob. Other allied troops began to give way as well. A counter attack by the Nassauers and the remains of Kielmansegge's brigade from the allied second line, led by  the Prince of Orange, was also thrown back and the Prince of Orange was seriously wounded. General Harlet brought up the 4th Grenadiers and the allied centre was now in serious danger of breaking.

The left flank of the square now came under fire from a heavy formation of British skirmishers, the chasseurs drove them back, but the skirmishers were replaced as the [[52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot|52nd Light Infantry]], led by [[John Colborne]], wheeled in line onto the chasseurs' flank and poured a devastating fire into them, the chasseurs returned a very sharp fire killing or wounding some 150 men of the 52nd.{{sfn|Field|2013|pp=203}} The 52nd then charged.&lt;ref name=Chesney-178 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Parry-70&gt;{{Harvnb|Parry|1900|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this onslaught, the chasseurs broke.&lt;ref name=Parry-70 /&gt;\nThe last of the Guard retreated headlong.

Wellington sent [[s:Wellingon's Waterloo dispatch to Lord Bathurst, 19 June 1815|his official dispatch]] describing the battle to England on 19 June 1815; it arrived in London on 21 June 1815 and was published as a ''[[London Gazette|London Gazette Extraordinary]]'' on 22 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17028|startpage=1213|date=22 June 1815|accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington, Blücher and other Coalition forces advanced upon Paris.\nNapoleon announced his [[abdication of Napoleon (1815)|second abdication]] on 24 June 1815.

He finally surrendered to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Frederick Lewis Maitland (Rear Admiral)|Frederick Maitland]] of [[Her Majesty's Ship|HMS]] ''[[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|Bellerophon]]'' on 15 July. There was a campaign against French fortresses that still held out; [[Longwy]] capitulated on 13 September 1815, the last to do so. The [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed on 20 November 1815.

The effectiveness of the lance was noted by all participants and this weapon subsequently became more widespread throughout Europe; the British converted their first light cavalry regiment to lancers in 1816, their uniforms, of Polish origin, were based on those of the [[Polish 1st Light Cavalry Regiment of the Imperial Guard|Imperial Guard lancers]].\n==Analysis==\n===Historical importance===\nWaterloo was a decisive battle in more than one sense. Every generation in Europe up to the outbreak of the [[First World War]] looked back at Waterloo as the turning point that dictated the course of subsequent world history. In retrospect, it was seen as the event that ushered in the [[Concert of Europe]], an era characterised by relative peace, material prosperity and technological progress.&lt;ref&gt;Barbero, p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; The battle definitively ended the series of wars that had convulsed Europe, and involved many other regions of the world, since the [[French Revolution]] of the early 1790s. It also ended the [[First French Empire]] and the political and military career of Napoleon Bonaparte, one of the greatest commanders and statesmen in history.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Through the finality of Napoleon's defeat, &quot;met his/her Waterloo&quot; has entered the English lexicon as a phrase to describe someone's circumstances when they have met with absolute and final defeat.&lt;/ref&gt;\nIt was followed by almost four decades of international peace in Europe. No further major conflict occurred until the [[Crimean War]]. Changes to the configuration of European states, as refashioned after Waterloo, included the formation of the [[Holy Alliance]] of reactionary governments intent on repressing revolutionary and democratic ideas, and the reshaping of the former [[Holy Roman Empire]] into a [[German Confederation]] increasingly marked by the political dominance of [[Prussia]].

He later served in the Russian Army.&lt;/ref&gt;\n{{quote|In my opinion, four principal causes led to this disaster:\nThe first, and most influential, was the arrival, skilfully combined, of Blücher, and the false movement that favoured this arrival;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;This &quot;false movement&quot; was the detachment of Grouchy's force in pursuit of the Prussians: Napoleon had overestimated the extent of his victory at Ligny and underestimated the resilience of the Prussians. He also seems to have discounted the presence of Bülow's substantial corps, which had not been in action at Ligny. Had Napoleon retained Grouchy's 30,000 men as a guard for his right flank, it is likely that these troops could have held off the Prussians and allowed the rest of Napoleon's army to attack Wellington's army unmolested.&lt;/ref&gt; the second, was the admirable firmness of the British infantry, joined to the sang-froid and aplomb of its chiefs; the third, was the horrible weather, that had softened the ground, and rendered the offensive movements so toilsome, and retarded till one o'clock the attack that should have been made in the morning; the fourth, was the inconceivable formation of the first corps, in masses very much too deep for the first grand attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jomini|1864|pp=223,224}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}\nWellington himself wrote in [[s:Wellingon's Waterloo dispatch to Lord Bathurst, 19 June 1815|his official dispatch]] back to London: &quot;I should not do justice to my own feelings, or to Marshal Blücher and the Prussian army, if I did not attribute the successful result of this arduous day to the cordial and timely assistance I received from them. The operation of General Bülow upon the enemy's flank was a most decisive one; and, even if I had not found myself in a situation to make the attack which produced the final result, it would have forced the enemy to retire if his attacks should have failed, and would have prevented him from taking advantage of them if they should unfortunately have succeeded.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;\nDespite their differences on other matters, discussed at length in [[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s study of the ''[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/five1-9.htm Campaign of 1815]'' and [http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/six.htm Wellington's famous 1842 essay] in reply to it, the Prussian theorist and historian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment. Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.&lt;ref&gt;''On Waterloo: Clausewitz, Wellington, and the Campaign of 1815'', by Carl von Clausewitz and Arthur Wellesley, first Duke of Wellington, ed./trans. Christopher Bassford, Daniel Moran, and Gregory W. Pedlow, Clausewitz.com, 2010, pp. 144-145 (Chapter 41 of Clausewitz's ''Feldzug''). This book contains complete versions of both Clausewitz's ''Feldzug'' and Wellington's lengthy reply. The [http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/index.htm complete text of both] is available on-line.&lt;/ref&gt;\nMany modern authors, however, share the view that Wellington faced imminent defeat without Prussian help. For example, Parkinson (2000) writes: &quot;Neither army beat Napoleon alone. But whatever the part played by Prussian troops in the actual moment when the Imperial Guard was repulsed, it is difficult to see how Wellington could have staved off defeat, when his centre had been almost shattered, his reserves were almost all committed, the French right remained unmolested and the Imperial Guard intact. …. Blucher may not have been totally responsible for victory over Napoleon, but he deserved full credit for preventing a British defeat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hussar General: The Life of Blucher, Man of Waterloo, By Roger Parkinson, Wordsworth Editions, 08 Nov 2000, pgs 240-241.&lt;/ref&gt; Zabecki (2014) writes: &quot;Blucher’s arrival not only diverted vital reinforcements, but also forced Napoleon to accelerate his effort against Wellington. The tide of battle had been turned by the hard-driving Blucher.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Germany at War: 400 Years of Military History, edited by David T. Zabecki Ph.D, ABC-CLIO, 28 Oct 2014, pg 178, at https://books.google.co.za/books?id=rCWMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1523&amp;dq=Zieten,+waterloo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=waterloo&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The issue is probably impossible to resolve, since in fact the Prussians arrived on the battlefield in increments and influenced events for hours before the French collapse. Thus victory is best ascribed to the Allies as a whole (including the substantial Dutch, Belgian, and German components of Wellington's army) rather than to either allied commander.\n==Battlefield today==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Waterloo Lion.jpg|thumb|The [[Lion's Mound]] at Waterloo]]\nSome portions of the terrain on the battlefield have been altered from their 1815 appearance. Tourism began the day after the battle, with Captain Mercer noting that on 19 June &quot;a carriage drove on the ground from Brussels, the inmates of which, alighting, proceeded to examine the field.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;M70&quot; /&gt; In 1820, the Netherlands' King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] ordered the construction of a monument. The [[Lion's Hillock]], a giant mound, was constructed here using {{convert|300000|m3|cuyd}} of earth taken from the ridge at the centre of the British line, effectively removing the southern bank of Wellington's sunken road.\n{{quote|Every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the plains, where the engagement between Napoleon and Wellington took place, are no longer what they were on 18&amp;nbsp;June 1815. By taking from this mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it, its real relief has been taken away, and history, disconcerted, no longer finds her bearings there. It has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying it. Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo once more, two years later, exclaimed, &quot;They have altered my field of battle!&quot; Where the great pyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, there was a hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles road, but which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe. The elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from Genappe to Brussels: one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other, the German tomb, is on the right. There is no French tomb. The whole of that plain is a sepulchre for France.|[[Victor Hugo]], ''[[Les Misérables]]''|&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugo&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hugo|1862|loc=Chapter VII: Napoleon in a Good Humor}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}\nThe alleged remark by Wellington about the alteration of the battlefield as described by Hugo was never documented, however.\nOther terrain features and notable landmarks on the field have remained virtually unchanged since the battle. These include the rolling farmland to the east of the Brussels–Charleroi Road as well as the buildings at Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and La Belle Alliance.\nApart from the Lion Mound, there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield. A cluster of monuments at the Brussels–Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud–Ohain crossroads marks the mass graves of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and [[King's German Legion]] troops. A monument to the French dead, entitled ''L'Aigle blessé'' (&quot;The Wounded Eagle&quot;), marks the location where it is believed one of the Imperial Guard units formed a square during the closing moments of the battle.{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6–21}}\nA monument to the Prussian dead is located in the village of [[Plancenoit]] on the site where one of their artillery batteries took position. The [[Guillaume Philibert Duhesme|Duhesme]] mausoleum is one among the few graves of the fallen. It is located at the side of Saint Martin's Church in Ways, a hamlet in the municipality of [[Genappe]].
