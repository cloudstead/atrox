However, after victory in the [[Battle of Shanghai]] expansionists prevailed within the Japanese military and on December 1 a campaign to capture Nanking was officially authorized. The task of occupying Nanking was given to General [[Iwane Matsui]], the commander of Japan's Central China Area Army, who believed that the capture of Nanking would force China to surrender and thus end the war. Chinese leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] ultimately decided to defend the city and appointed [[Tang Shengzhi]] to command the Nanking Garrison Force, a hastily assembled army of local conscripts and the remnants of the Chinese units who had fought in [[Shanghai]].\nJapanese soldiers marched from Shanghai to Nanking at a breakneck pace, rapidly defeating pockets of Chinese resistance. By December 9 they had reached the last line of defense, the Fukuo Line, behind which lay [[City Wall of Nanjing|Nanking's fortified walls]]. On December 10 Matsui ordered an all-out attack on Nanking, and after less than two days of intense fighting Chiang decided to abandon the city. Before fleeing, Tang ordered his men to launch a concerted breakout of the Japanese siege, but by this time Nanking was largely surrounded and its defenses were at the breaking point. Most of Tang's units simply collapsed, their soldiers often casting off their weapons and uniforms in the streets in the hopes of hiding among the city's civilian population.\nFollowing the capture of the city Japanese soldiers massacred Chinese prisoners of war, murdered civilians, and committed acts of looting and rape in an event known as the [[Nanking Massacre]]. Though Japan's military victory excited and emboldened them, the subsequent massacre tarnished their reputation in the eyes of the world. Contrary to Matsui's expectations, China did not surrender and the Second Sino-Japanese War continued for another eight years.\n==Prelude to the battle==\n===Japan's decision to capture Nanking===\nThe conflict which would become known as Second Sino-Japanese War started on July 7, 1937 with a [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident|skirmish at Marco Polo Bridge]] which escalated rapidly into a full-scale war in northern China between the armies of China and Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;war&quot;&gt;Jay Taylor, ''The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the Struggle for Modern China'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press, 2009), 145–147. Taylor's major primary source for this information is the diary of Chiang Kai-shek, as well as papers written by scholars Zhang Baijia and Donald Sutton.&lt;/ref&gt; China, however, wanted to avoid a decisive confrontation in the north and so instead opened a [[Battle of Shanghai|second front]] by attacking Japanese units in Shanghai in central China.&lt;ref name=&quot;war&quot;/&gt; The Japanese responded by dispatching the [[Shanghai Expeditionary Army]] (SEA), commanded by General [[Iwane Matsui]], to drive the Chinese Army from Shanghai.&lt;ref name=&quot;battle&quot;/&gt; Intense fighting in Shanghai forced Japan's [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office|Army General Staff]], which was in charge of military operations, to repeatedly reinforce the SEA, and finally on November 9 an entirely new army, the [[Tenth Army (Japan)|10th Army]] commanded by Lieutenant General [[Heisuke Yanagawa]], was also landed at [[Hangzhou Bay]] just south of Shanghai.&lt;ref name=&quot;battle&quot;/&gt;\nAlthough the arrival of the 10th Army succeeded at forcing the Chinese Army to retreat from Shanghai, the Japanese Army General Staff had decided to adopt a policy of non-expansion of hostilities with the aim of ending the war.&lt;ref&gt;Tokushi Kasahara, ''南京事件'' (Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 1997), 23–24, 52, 55, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 7 its ''de facto'' leader Deputy Chief of Staff [[Hayao Tada]] laid down an &quot;operation restriction line&quot; preventing its forces from leaving the vicinity of Shanghai, or more specifically from going west of the Chinese cites of [[Suzhou]] and [[Jiaxing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nanking&quot;&gt;Tokushi Kasahara, ''南京事件'' (Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 1997), 33, 60, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Nanking is 300 kilometers (186 miles) west of Shanghai.&lt;ref name=&quot;nanking&quot;/&gt;\n[[File:Iwane Matsui 01.jpg|thumb|General Iwane Matsui]]\nHowever, a major rift of opinion existed between the Japanese government and its two field armies, the SEA and 10th Army, which as of November were both nominally under the control of the [[Japanese Central China Area Army|Central China Area Army]] led by SEA commander Matsui.&lt;ref name=&quot;anatomy&quot;&gt;Masahiro Yamamoto, ''Nanking: Anatomy of an Atrocity'' (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2000), 43, 49–50.

By staying behind the operation restriction line at this point we are not only letting our chance to advance slip by, but it is also having the effect of encouraging the enemy to replenish their fighting strength and recover their fighting spirit and there is a risk that it will become harder to completely break their will to make war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Toshio Morimatsu, ''戦史叢書: 支那事変陸軍作戦(1)'' (Tokyo: Asagumo Shinbunsha, 1975), 418–419.

Yamamoto cites Masao Terada, planning chief of Japan's 10th Army.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's casualties were undoubtedly dwarfed by those of China, though no precise figures exist on how many Chinese were killed in action. The Japanese claimed to have killed 84,000 enemy during the campaign whereas a contemporary Chinese source claimed that their army suffered 20,000 casualties, but Masahiro Yamamoto notes that the Japanese usually inflated their opponent's body counts while the Chinese had reason to downplay the scale of their loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;casualties&quot;&gt;Masahiro Yamamoto, ''Nanking: Anatomy of an Atrocity'' (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2000), 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Ikuhiko Hata estimates that 50,000 Chinese soldiers were killed in combat during the entire battle&lt;ref name=&quot;echo&quot;/&gt; whereas Jay Taylor puts the number at 70,000 and states that proportionate to the size of the force committed, such losses were greater than those suffered in the devastating Battle of Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Richard Gibson, ''Chiang Kai-shek’s Central Army, 1924–1938'' (Washington DC: George Washington University, 1985), 388.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Chinese scholar Sun Zhaiwei estimates Chinese combat losses at 6,000 to 10,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jds.cass.cn/UploadFiles/zyqk/2010/12/201012101114478943.pdf|author=Zhaiwei Sun|title=南京大屠杀遇难同胞中究竟有多少军人|year=1997|journal=''抗日战争研究''|issue=04|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;\nAn official report of the Nationalist Government argued that an excess of untrained and inexperienced troops was a major cause of the defeat, but at the time Tang Shengzhi was made to bear much of the blame and later historians have also criticized him.&lt;ref name=&quot;fenby&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Masahiro Yamamoto, ''Nanking: Anatomy of an Atrocity'' (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2000), 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese historian Tokushi Kasahara, for instance, has characterized his battlefield leadership as incompetent, arguing that an orderly withdrawal from Nanking may have been possible if Tang had carried it out on December 11 or if he had not fled his post well in advance of most of his beleaguered units.&lt;ref&gt;Tokushi Kasahara, ''南京事件'' (Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 1997), 112, 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;永久保存版 – 三派合同 大アンケート,&quot; ''Shokun!'', February 2001, 184.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chiang's very decision to defend Nanking is also controversial.
