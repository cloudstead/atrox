The season is directly subsequent to ''[[Real World/Road Rules Extreme Challenge|Extreme Challenge]]''.\n''Battle of the Seasons'' premiered in early 2002 and took place in [[Cabo San Lucas]], [[Mexico]]. In each episode, the cast competed in a challenge, and the top three ''Real World'' and top three ''Road Rules'' teams would become the &quot;Inner Circle&quot; and have the power to vote off teams. The &quot;Inner Circle&quot; was determined by a cumulative score that would be tallied on a leader board. The final six teams would compete for a final prize worth $300,000.\nThis is the first edition of ''Battle of the Seasons'' series, with the second ''[[The Challenge: Battle of the Seasons|Battle of the Seasons]]'', following in 2012 with a completely different format.\n==Format==\nThis season of the ''The Challenge'' features a new format. Separated into teams of ''Real World'' and ''Road Rules'', each cast member is paired off with a cast mate from their original season. Each mission gave points based on finish. After each mission, the players with the most points cumulative from each team became the &quot;Inner Circle&quot; and voted off whichever pair they wanted. The individual winning pair of each challenge would earn an &quot;additional prize.&quot; After five pairs from each team were voted off, the final three ''Real World'' teams and final three ''Road Rules'' teams would compete against each other in a series of challenges before the final race, which would earn the winning teams $300,000 for themselves, $50,000 per teammate.\n==Cast==\n'''Hosts:''' [[Eric Nies]] from ''[[The Real World: New York]]'' and [[Mark Long]] from ''[[Road Rules: USA - The First Adventure]]''\n{|\n|-\n|\n{|class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot;\n|+ Real World team\n|-\n!

The contraption is made so after one team member falls, the other team member will fall immediately.\n**'''Winners:''' ''Theo &amp; Holly B.'' (''Team Road Rules'')\n* '''Musical Inner-Tube Tango:''' In a game similar to musical chairs, teams will dance around a pool. Once the music stops, they must get an inner tube around their head. After each round, there will be two less inner-tubes. If one person from a team does not get an inner-tube, the whole team is eliminated.\n**'''Winners:''' ''Stephen &amp; Lindsay'' (''Team Real World'')\n* '''Vertical Limit:''' Each member of the team will climb as high as they can on a rope with buoys on it in three minutes. They will gain a point for every buoy they pass. If they fall off the rope, they cannot get back on, and the number they ended on will be their final number.\n**'''Winners:''' ''Danny &amp; Kelley'' (''Team Real World'')\n* '''Slam Dunk '''- Teams will bungee jump together back to back and try to score into hoops valued at 5, 10, and 15 points.\n**'''Winners:''' ''Theo &amp; Holly B.'' (''Team Road Rules'')\n* '''Ladder of Doom:''' A relay race where each member needs to climb down a ladder over a 50-foot basin and retrieve a flag and bring it back to the top of the ladder.\n**'''Winners:''' ''Theo &amp; Holly B.'' (''Team Road Rules'')\n* '''Round 'Em Up:''' Teams will enter a ring on horses and have a maximum of 15 minutes to round up at least one cow and get it into the pen.\n**'''Winners:''' ''Sean &amp; Elka'' (''Team Real World'')\n* '''Rush Hour:''' Teams will have to move one car out of the puzzle by moving other cars within the puzzle forward and backwards. The cars are not allowed to make any turns. Cars are also not allowed to hit any other cars; if this does happen, the team will be disqualified, and receive a score of 0. Teams will be sequestered for fairness.\n**'''Winners:''' ''Sean &amp; Elka'' (''Team Real World'')\n* '''Hands on the Saturn:''' Teams must have at least one whole hand on an ice sculpture of a Saturn sedan at all times. After two, three, and four hours, competitors must place another extremity (hand or feet) until all four are on the ice. Five minute breaks are allotted every three hours.\n**'''Winners:''' ''Dan &amp; Tara'' (''Team Road Rules'')\n* '''Sidekick Showdown:''' Similar to the game show, [[The Newlywed Game]], team members must match answers to their team member's responses to personal questions.\n**'''Winners:''' ''Mike M. &amp; Coral'' (''Team Real World'')\n* '''Blockhead:''' Each member of the team has a responsibility: a swimmer and a builder. The swimmer must go into the ocean and retrieve cubes. The builder then must build a tower at least 4 cubes high with all the same color face of each cube facing outwards. Afterwards, one player must stand on the structure and blow a whistle.\n**'''Winners:''' ''Timmy &amp; Emily'' (''Team Road Rules'')\n* '''Siamese Wrestling:''' Team members will be bound together back to back wrestling another team. The teams need to pin down (a shoulder touching the mat) the other team for three seconds. It will be broken into two rounds: the first round will be two minutes and the second round will be a sudden death.\n**'''Winners:''' ''Timmy &amp; Emily'' (''Team Road Rules'')\n* '''Handsome Reward:''' Ultimate Teams (''Sean &amp; Elka'' and ''Theo &amp; Holly'') must delegate tasks for each team members to accomplish. The finale is divided into a relay race collecting fish through three components: kayaking, deep-sea diving, a long-board paddling. Afterwards, the whole team uses the fish they collected to figure out a puzzle. Once completed, they must climb a ladder to the top of a cliff to cross the finish line.\n**'''Winners:''' ''Team Real World'' (''Sean &amp; Elka'', ''Mike M. &amp; Coral'', and ''Danny &amp; Kelley'')\n==Game summary==\n===Elimination chart===\n{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

The special was hosted by Lindsay Brien from ''[[The Real World: Seattle]]'' and Mark Long from ''[[Road Rules: USA – The First Adventure]]''.\n==Memorable moments==\n* Belou was judged for bringing her infant child along to live in the ''Challenge'' household, who in turn, excoriated her fellow Road Rulers for questioning her competence as a mother.\n* Jisela confronted Theo, Holly B., Piggy and Chadwick on their alliance in the Inner Circle.\n* A hurricane stopped production and the cast had to be relocated to a hotel where they threw the [[toga party]]. Many events had to be thrown together due to the logistical turmoil brought by the storm.\n* Veronica &amp; Yes and Beth &amp; Jon were the first people voted off their teams. The former team was voted off because the Inner Circle had decided to knock out stronger teams, while the latter team was out because everyone wanted to get rid of Beth, who singularly blamed Norman due to old jealousies.\n* Emily got into a confrontation with Chadwick, Holly B. &amp; Piggy after she had told the other teams about the Inner Circle's alliance. While being confronted by Jisela, Chadwick denied all claims of an alliance and called Emily a liar. Even after being voted off, Chadwick sent Emily a nasty e-mail, blaming her for manipulating the game and having him sent home.\n* Although Holly B. and Chadwick had been advocates of the plan to vote off strong teams, when Chadwick and Piggy finished outside the Inner Circle, Holly suddenly decided that they should vote off the weakest team instead of the one that Chadwick (her husband) was on. The rest of the Inner Circle didn't like the hypocrisy and did end up voting out Chadwick and Piggy.\n* Coral got into an argument with Stephen on the first day.\n* Team ''Real World'' devised a contract stipulating that the teams would be voted off according to the point system that was given to them. They followed this contract, except in the case where the team decided to vote off Lindsay &amp; Stephen, mostly because Stephen was driving everyone crazy with his hectoring personality.\n* Hookups during the challenge included: Mike M. and Tara, Timmy and Holly, and Theo and Coral.\n* The ''Real World'' teams and ''Road Rules'' teams all decided that whoever won the final challenge would split the money with the opposite team. The teams formulated contracts so each cast member would get a share of the [[prize money]]. Holly B. thought that this was stupid and thought that the ''Road Rules'' team was going to win, and indicated that she would not split her money with Coral. Consequently, when they lost Coral decided to keep her money and gloated over it.\n* This challenge would mark the last challenge that ''Real World'' ever won the final reward challenge and prizes.\n* This challenge also marked the end of the six versus six challenge theme.\n* Lori from Back to New York was Mike's original team mate but she dropped out at the last minute and was replaced by Coral.  According to Mike's appearance on [[Bill Simmons]]' ''B.S. Report'' podcast, Lori dropped out due to fear of flying following the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]] attacks.\n* During a 9/18/2013 appearance on [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo's]] [[Watch What Happens: Live]], Danny Roberts dished that, on one of the challenges, he hooked up with a straight male cast member who is now married.  He did not share any additional details until later in the show, stating that Trishelle Cannatella (someone he had never met), &quot;hate called&quot; him.  The call was connected to the hookup he previously mentioned. Immediate thought was that Danny hooked up with Steven Hill, Trishelle's Real World Vegas ex.  However, Trishelle used Twitter to clarify it wasn't Steven.  Current thought is the hookup in question is Adam Larson, another ex of Trishelle's who participated in this challenge with Danny.\n* Stephen's belligerence and violence towards the women at the Musical Inner-Tube Tango infuriated both teams.\n* Although the ''Real World'' was unified in their hatred of Stephen, Norman became upset at the inner circle when Stephen and Lindsay were voted off.\n* Jisela exploded at the inner circle after discovering the alliance between the top three teams, calling a team meeting and annoying her teammates. The ''Road Rules'' team would admit on the reunion that they were overjoyed to send her home.\n* Holly nearly quit the Sidekick Showdown challenge after Theo told her he had read that she wanted a breast enhancement on the Internet.\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n==External links==\n*{{Wayback|url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/rwrr_challenge/battle_seasons/|title=Official website|date=20061118154049}}\n* [http://roadrules.mtv.com MTV's official ''Road Rules'' Website]\n* [http://www.mtv.com/onair/realworld/ MTV's official ''Real World'' Website]\n{{RWRR|chal}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Real World Road Rules Challenge: Battle of the Seasons}}\n[[Category:The Challenge (TV series)|Battle of the Seasons]]\n[[Category:2002 television seasons]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Mexico]]"
