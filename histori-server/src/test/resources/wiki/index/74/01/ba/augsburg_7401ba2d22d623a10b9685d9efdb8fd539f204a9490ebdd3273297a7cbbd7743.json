The oldest part of the city and the southern quarters are on the northern foothills of a high terrace, which emerged between the steep rim of the hills of [[Friedberg (Bayern)|Friedberg]] in the east and the high hills of the west. In the south extends the Lechfeld, a [[Outwash plain]] of the post [[ice age]] between the rivers [[Lech (river)|Lech]] and [[Wertach]], where rare primeval landscapes were preserved. The Augsburg city forest and the Lech valley heaths today rank among the most species-rich middle European habitats.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\nOn Augsburg borders the [[nature park]] [[Augsburg Western Woods Nature Park|Augsburg Western Woods]] - a large forestland. The city itself is also heavily greened.

The name means &quot;''Augusta of the [[Vindelicia|Vindelici]]''&quot;. This garrison camp soon became the capital of the Roman province of [[Raetia]].\nEarly development was due to a 400-year affiliation with the [[Roman Empire]], especially because of its excellent military, economic and geographic position at the convergence of the [[Alps|Alpine]] rivers [[Lech (river)|Lech]] and [[Wertach (river)|Wertach]], and with direct access to most important Alpine passes. Thus, Augsburg was the intersection of many important European east-west and north-south connections, which later evolved as major trade routes of the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.augsburg.de/index.php?id=12356 |title=Stadt Augsburg - Home - Stadt Augsburg |publisher=.augsburg.de |date=2014-05-01 |accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg.jpg|thumb|left|Territories of the Free Imperial City and the Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg]]\nAround 120 AD Augsburg became the capital of the Roman province [[Raetia]].

Frictions between the city-state and the prince-bishops were to remain frequent however, particularly after Augsburg became Protestant and curtailed the rights and freedoms of Catholics.\nWith a strategic location as intersection of trade routes to Italy, the Free Imperial City became a major trading center. Augsburg produced large quantities of woven goods, cloth and textiles. Augsburg became the base of two banking families that rose to great prominence, the [[Fugger]]s and the [[Welser]]s. The Fugger family donated the [[Fuggerei]] part of the city devoted to housing for needy citizens in 1516, which remains in use today.\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Augusta vendilicorum.png|thumb|left|Panorama of Augsburg, 1493]]\n[[File:Augsburg1550.jpg|thumb|left|Perlach market place in 1550.]]\nIn 1530, the [[Augsburg Confession]] was presented to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the [[Diet of Augsburg]]. Following the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555, after which the rights of religious minorities in imperial cities were to be legally protected, a mixed Catholic–Protestant city council presided over a majority Protestant population; ''see [[:de:Paritätische Reichsstadt|Paritätische Reichsstadt]]''.\n===Thirty Years' War===\nReligious peace in the city was largely maintained despite increasing Confessional tensions until the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648). In 1629, Holy Roman Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] issued the [[Edict of Restitution]], which restored the legal situation. of 1552 which again curtailed the rights of the Protestant citizens. The inequality of the [[Edict of Restitution]] was rescinded when in April 1632, the Swedish army under [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]] captured Augsburg without resistance.\nIn 1634, the Swedish army was routed at nearby [[Nördlingen]]. By October 1634, Catholic troops had surrounded Augsburg. The Swedish garrison refused to surrender and a siege ensued through the winter of 1634/35 and thousands died from hunger and disease. According to J. N. Hays, &quot;In the period of the Swedish occupation and the Imperial siege the population of the city was reduced from about 70,000 to about 16,000, with [[typhus]] and [[Black Death|plague]] playing major roles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=GyE8Qt-kS1kC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=&amp;lr=&amp;hl=en&amp;cd=23#v=onepage&amp;q=false Epidemics and pandemics: their impacts on human history]''&quot;. J. N. Hays (2005). p.98. ISBN 1-85109-658-2&lt;/ref&gt;\n===Nine Years' War===\nIn 1686, [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] formed the ''League of Augsburg'', termed by the English as the &quot;Grand Alliance&quot; after England joined in 1689: a [[Europe]]an [[coalition]], consisting (at various times) of [[Austria]], [[Bavaria]], [[Brandenburg]], England, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Palatinate]] of the Rhine, [[Portugal]], [[Savoy]], [[Saxony]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]]. It was formed to defend the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Palatinate]] from France. This organization fought against France in the [[Nine Years War]].\nAugsburg's peak boom years occurred during the 15th and 16th centuries thanks to the bank and metal businesses of the merchant families Fugger and Welser, who held a local near total monopoly on their respective industries. Augsburg's wealth attracted artists seeking patrons and rapidly became a creative centre for famous painters, sculptors and musicians notably birthplace of : the [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]] painter family.  In later centuries the city was the birthplace of the composer [[Leopold Mozart]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/artist/leopold-mozart-mn0001498289/biography&lt;/ref&gt; and the playwright [[Berthold Brecht]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zwmvd2p/revision&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rococo]] became so prevalent that it became known as “Augsburg style” throughout Germany.\n===End of Free Imperial City status and Industrial Revolution revival===\n[[File:Stockdale 1800 - Augsburg.jpeg|thumb|right|A map of Augsburg in 1800.]]\nIn 1806, when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was dissolved, Augsburg lost its independence and was annexed to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]]. In 1817, the city became an administrative capital of the ''Oberdonaukreis'', then administrative capital in 1837 for the district [[Swabia (administrative region)|Swabia and Neuburg]].\nDuring the end of the 19th century, [[Augsburg textile and industry museum|Augsburg's textile industry]] again rose to prominence followed by the connected machine manufacturing industry.\n===Military===\nAugsburg was historically a militarily important city due to its strategic location.\nDuring the German re-armament before [[World War II|the Second World War]], the Wehrmacht enlarged Augsburg's one original Kaserne (barracks) to three: Somme Kaserne ((housing Wehrmacht Artillerie-Regiment 27)); Arras Kaserne ((housing Wehrmacht Infanterie Regiment 27)) and Panzerjäger Kaserne (housing Panzerabwehr-Abteilung 27 (later Panzerjäger-Abteilung 27). Wehrmacht Panzerjäger-Abteilung 27 was later moved to [[Füssen]].\nDuring [[World War II]], one subcamp of the [[Dachau concentration camp]] was located outside Augsburg, supplying approximately 1,300 forced labourers to local military-related industry, most especially the [[Messerschmitt]] AG military aircraft firm headquartered in Augsburg.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Sofsky, William Templer, ''The Order of Terror: The Concentration Camp'': Princeton University Press: 1999, ISBN 0-691-00685-7: 352 pages: pp 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Victor. ''Alphabetical List of Camps, Subcamps and Other Camps.'' http://www.edwardvictor.com/Holocaust/List%20of%20camps.htm&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn 1941, [[Rudolf Hess]] without [[Adolf Hitler]]'s permission secretly took off from a local airport and flew to [[Scotland]] to meet the [[Duke of Hamilton]], and crashed in [[Eaglesham]] in an attempt to mediate the end of the European front of [[World War II]] and join sides for the upcoming Russian Campaign.\nThe Reichswehr Infanterie Regiment 19 was stationed in Augsburg and became the base unit for the Wehrmacht Infanterie Regiment 40, a subsection of the Wehrmacht Infanterie Division 27 (which later became the Wehrmacht Panzerdivision 17). Elements of Wehrmacht II Battalion of Gebirgs-Jäger-Regiment 99 (especially Wehrmacht Panzerjäger Kompanie 14) was composed of parts of the Wehrmacht Infanterie Division 27. The Infanterie Regiment 40 remained in Augsburg until the end of the war, finally surrendering to the United States when in 1945, the [[U.S. Army]] occupied the [[Bombing of Augsburg in World War II|heavily bombed and damaged city]].\nFollowing the war, the three Kaserne would change hands confusingly between the [[United States|American]] and Germans, finally ending up in US hands for the duration of the [[Cold War]]. The former Wehrmacht Kaserne became the three main US barracks in Augsburg: Reese;, Sheridan and FLAK. US Base FLAK had been an anti-aircraft barracks since 1936 and US Base Sheridan &quot;united&quot; the former infantry barracks with a smaller Kaserne for former [[Luftwaffe]] communications units.\nThe American military presence in the city started with the [[U.S. 11th Airborne Division|11th Airborne Division]], followed by the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]], U.S. Army [[Seventh Corps Artillery]], [[701st Military Intelligence Brigade|USASA Field Station Augsburg]] and finally the [[66th Military Intelligence Brigade (United States)|66th Military Intelligence Brigade]], which returned the former Kaserne to German hands in 1998. Originally the Heeresverpflegungshauptamt Südbayern and an Officers' caisson existed on or near the location of Reese-Kaserne, but was demolished by the occupying Americans.\n==Politics==\n===Municipality===\n{{main|List of mayors of Augsburg}}\nFrom 1266 until 1548, the terms ''Stadtpfleger'' (head of town council) and ''[[Mayor]]'' were used interchangeably, or occasionally, simultaneously.\nIn 1548 the title was finally fixed to ''Stadtpfleger'', who officiated for several years and was then awarded the title for life (though no longer governing), thus resulting confusingly, in records of two or more simultaneous ''Stadtpfleger''.\nAfter the transfer to [[Bavaria]] in 1806, Augsburg was ruled by a [[Magistrate]] with two mayors, supported by an additional council of &quot;Community Commissioners&quot;: the ''Gemeindebevollmächtige''.\nAs of 1907, the Mayor was entitled [[Lord Mayor|Oberbürgermeister]], as Augsburg had reached a population of 100,000, as per the Bavarian [[Gemeindeordnung]].\n===Town Council===\n{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;\n! class=&quot;hintergrundfarbe5&quot; colspan=&quot;12&quot;| Election results of the Town Council since 1972 in percent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augsburg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/buergerservice_rathaus/rathaus/statisiken_und_geodaten/statistiken/jahrbuch/jahrbuch_2012.pdf Statistisches Jahrbuch der Stadt Augsburg – Chapter 11: Election results of the Town Council since 1946] (PDF; 2,6&amp;nbsp;MB)&lt;/ref&gt;\n|-\n!

It is controlled by the [[Augsburger Verkehrsverbund]] (Augsburg transport union, AVV) extended over central Swabia. There are seven rail [[Regionalbahn]] lines, five [[tram]] lines, 27 city bus lines and six night bus lines, as well as, several taxi companies.\nThe [[Trams in Augsburg|Augsburg tramway network]] is now 35.5&amp;nbsp;km-long after the opening of new lines to the [[University of Augsburg|university]] in 1996, the northern city boundary in 2001 and to the Klinikum Augsburg (Augsburg hospital) in 2002. Tram line 6, which runs 5.2&amp;nbsp;km from Friedberg West to Rotes Tor, opened in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/urban-rail-news-in-brief-10.html|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Railway Gazette: Urban rail news in brief}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n====Rail services====\n[[File:Bahnhofsgebäude Augsburg.JPG|thumb|The front of the station]]\nAugsburg has six stations, the [[Augsburg Central Station|Central Station]] (''Hauptbahnhof''), [[Augsburg-Hochzoll station|Hochzoll]], [[Augsburg-Oberhausen station|Oberhausen]], [[Augsburg Morellstraße station|Morellstraße]] and ''Messe''. The Central Station, built from 1843 to 1846, is Germany’s oldest main station in a large city still providing services in the original building. It is currently being modernized and an underground tram station is built underneath it. [[Augsburg Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]] is on the [[Munich–Augsburg railway|Munich–Augsburg]] and [[Ulm–Augsburg railway|Ulm–Augsburg lines]] and is connected by [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] and [[InterCity|IC]] services to [[Munich]], [[Berlin]], [[Dortmund]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Stuttgart]]. As of December 2007, the French [[TGV]] connected Augsburg with a direct High Speed Connection to [[Paris]]. In addition [[EuroCity|EC]] and night train services connect to [[Amsterdam]], [[Paris]] and [[Vienna]] and connections will be substantially improved by the creation of the planned [[Magistrale for Europe]].\nThe AVV operates seven [[Regionalbahn]] lines from the main station to:\n* [[Mammendorf]]\n* [[Schmiechen]] (direction to [[Ammersee]]\n* [[Aichach]]/[[Kühbach|Radersdorf]]\n* [[Meitingen]]/[[Donauwörth]]\n* [[Dinkelscherben]]\n* [[Schwabmünchen]]\n* [[Klosterlechfeld]]\nStarting in 2008, the regional services are planned to be altered to [[S-Bahn]] frequencies and developed long term as integrated into the [[Augsburg S-Bahn]].\n===Air transport===\nUntil 2005 Augsburg was served by nearby [[Augsburg Airport]] (AGB). In that year all air passenger transport was relocated to [[Munich Airport]]. Since then the Airport has only served for [[General aviation]] and [[Commercial aviation|business aviation]].\n==Economy==\n[[File:StMichaelAugsburg.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Archangel Michael]] in Augsburg]]\n[[File:Industrial robots-transparent.gif|thumb|[[KUKA]]'s industrial robots]]\nAugsburg is a vibrant industrial city. Many global market leaders namely [[MAN SE|MAN]], [[EADS]] or [[KUKA]] produce high technology products like printing systems, large diesel engines, [[industrial robots]] or components for the [[Airbus A380]] and the [[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane]] carrier rocket. After Munich, Augsburg is considered the high-tech centre for Information and Communication in Bavaria and takes advantage of its lower operating costs, yet close proximity to [[Munich]] and potential customers.\n===Major companies===\n* [[Boewe Systec]]\n* [[Premium AEROTEC]]\n* [[Faurecia]]\n* [[Fujitsu Technology Solutions]]\n* [[KUKA]] Robotics / Systems\n* [[MAN SE|MAN]] (Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg)\n* [[MAN Roland|manroland]]\n* [[MT-Aerospace]] (former ''MAN Technologie'')\n* [[NCR Corporation|NCR]]\n* [[Osram]]\n* [[Premium AEROTEC]]\n* [[Siemens]]\n* [[UPM-Kymmene]] (former Haindl)\n* Verlagsgruppe [[Weltbild]]\n* [[WashTec]] (former Kleindienst)\n* [[synlab Group]]\n* [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]\n* [[Cancom]]\n==Education==\nAugsburg is home to the following universities and colleges:\n* [[University of Augsburg]], founded in 1970&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-augsburg.de www.uni-augsburg.de]&lt;/ref&gt;\n* [[Augsburg University of Applied Sciences|Hochschule Augsburg]] (University of Applied Sciences, formerly Fachhochschule Augsburg)\n==Media==\nThe local newspaper is the ''[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]'' first published in 1807.
