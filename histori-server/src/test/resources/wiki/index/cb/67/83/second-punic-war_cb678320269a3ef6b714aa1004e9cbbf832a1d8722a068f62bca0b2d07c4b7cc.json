This was the second major war between [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and the [[Roman Republic]] and its allied Italic [[socii]], with the crucial participation of [[Numidians|Numidian]]-[[Berber people|Berber]] armies and tribes on both sides. The two states had three major conflicts against each other over the course of their existence. They are called the &quot;[[Punic Wars]]&quot; because Rome's name for Carthaginians was ''Poeni'', derived from ''Poenici'' (earlier form of ''Punici''), a reference to the founding of Carthage by [[Phoenicia]]n settlers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoenician.org/carthage_hannibal_barca.htm Phoenicians: Carthage &amp; Hannibal] at phoenician.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book\n| last = Sidwell\n| first = Keith C\n| authorlink =\n|author2=Peter V.

In the following year (216), Hannibal's army defeated the Romans again, this time in southern Italy at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]. In consequence of these defeats, many Roman allies went over to Carthage, prolonging the war in Italy for over a decade. Against Hannibal's skill on the battlefield, the Romans deployed the [[Fabian strategy]]. Roman forces were more capable in siege warfare than the Carthaginians and recaptured all of the major cities that had joined the enemy, as well as defeating a Carthaginian attempt to reinforce Hannibal at the [[Battle of the Metaurus]]. In the meantime, in [[Iberia]], which served as the main source of manpower for the Carthaginian army, a second Roman expedition under [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major]] took [[Cartagena, Spain|Carthago Nova]] by assault and ended Carthaginian rule over Iberia in the [[Battle of Ilipa]]. The final showdown was the [[Battle of Zama]] in Africa between Scipio Africanus and Hannibal, resulting in the latter's defeat and the imposition of harsh peace conditions on Carthage ([[Carthaginian peace]]), which ceased to be a major power and became a Roman client-state.\nA sideshow of this war was the indecisive [[First Macedonian War]] in the Eastern Mediterranean and the [[Ionian Sea]].\nAll battles mentioned in the introduction are ranked among the [[List of battles by casualties#Classical formation battles|most costly traditional battles of human history]]; in addition, there were a few successful ambushes of armies that also ended in their annihilation.\n==Background==\n{{For|an analysis of the strength and organisation of Roman forces on the eve of the war|Socii#Military organisation of the Roman alliance}}\nThe Second Punic War was fought between Carthage and Rome and was ignited by the dispute over the [[hegemony]] of [[Saguntum]], a [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] Iberian coastal city with diplomatic contacts with Rome.&lt;ref name=mahaney2008&gt;Mahaney, W.C., 2008, Hannibal's Odyssey: Environmental Background to the Alpine Invasion of Italia.

The city called for Roman aid, but the pleas fell on deaf ears. Following a prolonged [[siege]] and a bloody struggle, in which Hannibal himself was wounded and the army practically destroyed, the Carthaginians finally took control of the city. Many of the Saguntians chose to commit suicide rather than face subjugation by the Carthaginians.\nBefore the war, Rome and [[Hasdrubal the Fair]] had made a treaty. [[Livy]] reports that it was agreed that the [[Iber]] should be the boundary between the two empires and that the liberty of the Saguntines should be preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy&quot;&gt;[[Livy]].

''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D35 3.35.1]&lt;/ref&gt; it was thus one of the largest in the Hellenistic world and equal in numbers to any that the Romans had yet fielded. Hannibal departed with this army from New Carthage ([[Cartagena, Spain]]) northwards along the coast in late spring of 218 BC. At the [[Ebro]], he split the army into three columns and subdued the tribes from there to the [[Pyrenees]] within weeks, but with severe losses. At the Pyrenees, he left a detachment of 11,000 Iberian troops, who showed reluctance to leave their homeland, as a garrison for the newly conquered region.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D35 3.35.4&amp;ndash;5]&lt;/ref&gt; Hannibal reportedly entered [[Gaul]] with 50,000 infantry and 9,000 cavalry. He took his army by an inland route,&lt;ref name=mahaney2008 /&gt; avoiding the Roman allies along the coast. In Gaul, negotiations helped him to move unmolested except for the [[Battle of Rhone Crossing]], where a force of the [[Allobroges]] unsuccessfully tried to oppose his 38,000 infantry (that number may exclude light infantry), 8,000 cavalry, and 37 war elephants from the other shore.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby 41&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn the meantime, a Roman fleet with an invasion force was underway to northern Iberia. Its commanders, the brothers [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus]] and [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]], knew that Hannibal had crossed the Ebro, but were surprised by the Carthaginian army's presence at the [[Rhone]] upstream of their ally [[Marseille|Massalia]], where they had landed. A scouting party of 300 cavalry was sent to discover the whereabouts of the enemy.&lt;ref name=mahaney2008 /&gt; These eventually defeated a Carthaginian scouting troop of 500 mounted Numidians and chased them back to their main camp. Thus, with knowledge of the location of the enemy, the Romans marched upstream, ready for battle. Hannibal evaded this force and by an unknown route reached (the [[Isère River|Isère]] or the [[Durance River|Durance]]) the foot of the Alps in autumn.&lt;ref name=mahaney2008 /&gt; He also received messengers from his Gallic allies in Italy that urged him to come to their aid and offered to guide him over the Alps. Before setting out to cross the Alps, he was re-supplied by a native tribe, some of whose hereditary disputes he had helped solve.\n====First Roman expedition to Iberia====\n[[Image:Relieve de Osuna (M.A.N.

By its inherent weight distribution, it could deliver blows as powerful as an axe. National Archaeological Museum of Spain, Madrid]]\nThe first Roman expedition to Iberia was unable to bring the Carthaginian troops in the hinterland of [[Marseille|Massalia]] to a [[pitched battle]], so it continued on its way to northern Iberia under [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus]], a move which proved decisive for the outcome of the war. Their other commander, [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]], returned to Rome, realizing the danger of an invasion of Italy where the tribes of the [[Boii]] and [[Insubres]] were already in revolt. After 217 BC, he also traveled to Iberia.\nIn Iberia, Carthaginian rule was not popular, but Roman inaction during the siege of [[Saguntum]] had made the natives cautious about an alliance against their masters. Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus established his headquarters at [[Tarraco|Cissa]], in the midst of Hannibal's latest acquisition, the area between Ebro and Pyrenees. Despite initial setbacks, he won increasing support among the natives. This convinced the Carthaginian commander [[Hanno, son of Bomilcar|Hanno]], the nephew of Hannibal, to accept pitched battle before his troops had been united with the army under [[Hasdrubal (Barcid)|Hasdrubal]], the brother of Hannibal, despite being outnumbered 2 to 1. The result was a Roman victory in the [[Battle of Cissa]] in 218 BC. When Hasdrubal finally made it to the scene, he was in no position to fight the Roman army and merely caught their navy personnel off-guard, killing some of them in the process.\nThe combined Roman and [[Marseille|Massalia]]n fleet and army posed a threat to the Carthaginians. Hasdrubal intended to first defeat the fleet. However, his naval forces had a history of failure against the Romans. They had lost all but one major naval engagement in the [[First Punic War]] and in 218 BC a naval engagement in the waters of [[Lilybaeum]] had been lost despite numerical superiority. For this reason, he moved the army and fleet together. The fleet is described as being very disorganized prior to the battle. The army, in the meantime, provided loud moral support and a safe harbour for the ensuing naval [[Battle of Ebro River]]. The 40 Carthaginian and Iberian vessels were severely defeated by the 55 Roman and Massalian ships in the second naval engagement of the war, with about three quarters of the fleet captured or sunk and the rest beaching their ships with the army on the shore. In the aftermath, the Carthaginian forces retreated, but the Romans were still confined to the area between Ebro and Pyrenees.\nThis position prevented the Carthaginians from sending reinforcements from Iberia to Hannibal or to the insurgent Gauls in northern Italy during critical stages of the war. To deal with this problem, Hasdrubal marched into Roman territory in 215 BC and offered [[battle of Dertosa|battle at Dertosa]]. In this battle, he used his cavalry superiority to clear the field and to envelop the enemy on both sides with his infantry, a tactic that had been very successfully employed in Italy. However, the Romans broke through the thinned out line in the centre and defeated both wings separately, inflicting severe losses; but, not without taking heavy losses themselves.\nWhile little progress was made in the Iberian theatre, the Scipios were able to negotiate a new front in Africa by allying themselves with [[Syphax]], a powerful [[Numidians|Numidian]] king in North Africa. In 213 BC, he received Roman advisers to train his heavy infantry soldiers that had not yet been able to stand up to their Carthaginian counterparts. With this support, he waged war against the Carthaginian ally [[List of Kings of Numidia#Kings of Eastern Numidia|Gala]]. According to [[Appian]], in 213 BC [[Hasdrubal (Barcid)|Hasdrubal]] left Iberia and fought Syphax, though he may be confused with [[Hasdrubal Gisco]], however, it did bind Carthaginian resources.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyos 139&lt;/ref&gt; Hasdrubal Gisco is the son of the Gesco who had served together with [[Hamilcar Barca]], Hannibal's father, in Sicily during the First Punic War and son-in-law of [[Hanno the Elder]] who was one of Hannibal's lieutenants in Italy.\n===Central Mediterranean (218–213 BC)===\n====Naval raids and expeditions====\nIn 218 BC, the Carthaginian navy was busy scouting [[Sicily|Sicilian]] waters and preparing for a surprise attack on their former key stronghold of [[Lilybaeum]] on the western tip of the island. Twenty [[quinquereme]]s, loaded with 1,000 soldiers, raided the [[Aegadian Islands]] west of Sicily and eight ships intended to attack the [[Aeolian Islands]], but were blown off-course in a storm towards the Straits of Messina. The Syracusan navy, then at Messina, managed to capture three of these ships without resistance. Learning from their crews that a Carthaginian fleet was to attack Lilybaeum, [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]] warned the Roman [[praetor]] Marcus Amellius there. As a result, the Romans prepared 20 [[quinquereme]]s to intercept, and defeated the 35 Carthaginian quinqueremes in the [[Battle of Lilybaeum]].\nIn 218 BC, preparations were made to launch a Roman expedition from Lilybaeum against Africa. Hannibal had anticipated the move and reinforced the defending army in Africa with 13,850 Iberian heavy infantry, 870 Balearic slingers and 1,200 Iberian cavalry. In addition, some 4,000 Iberian men &quot;of good family were called up who were under orders to be conveyed to Carthage to strengthen its defence, and also to serve as hostages for the loyalty of their people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy&quot; /&gt;{{rp|[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10907/10907-h/10907-h.htm#c21 21.21]}} In return, 11,850 [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] infantry, 300 [[Ligurians]], and 500 Balearic slingers were sent to Iberia to strengthen the local defence against the other anticipated Roman invasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy&quot; /&gt;{{rp|[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10907/10907-h/10907-h.htm#c22 21.22]}}\nThe Carthaginian navy had been defeated by the Romans in two major encounters, but neither side was usually able to stop the other from raiding each other's coasts. An exception was in 217 BC, when a Carthaginian fleet of 70 quinqueremes was intercepted off the coast of [[Etruria]] by a Roman fleet of 120 quinqueremes and retreated without giving battle.\nThe first Carthaginian expedition to [[Sardinia]], in 215 BC, was under the command of [[Hasdrubal The Bald]] with his subordinate [[Hampsicora]]. A previous pro-Carthaginian uprising had been defeated, while a storm had blown the Carthaginian fleet to the [[Balearic Islands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy&quot; /&gt;{{rp|[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10907/10907-h/10907-h.htm#e34 23.24]}} When they finally made it to Sardinia, the Romans were aware of their intentions and had reinforced the unpopular garrison under [[Titus Manlius Torquatus (dictator)|Titus Manlius Torquatus]] to 20,000 infantry and 1,200 cavalry. These engaged and defeated the Carthaginians' 15,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry (plus an unknown number of elephants) and the remaining insurgent Sardinians at the [[Battle of Cornus]]. In the aftermath, the defeated expedition of 60 quinqueremes and several transports encountered a Roman raiding party from Africa with 100 quinqueremes. The Carthaginian fleet scattered and escaped save for seven ships. As a result, Sardinia, an important grain exporter, remained under Roman occupation.\n====Gallic uprising====\nThe Romans simultaneously received news of Hannibal's crossing of the Ebro and of an uprising in northern Italy of the Gallic tribes [[Boii]] and [[Insubres]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy&quot; /&gt;{{rp|[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10907/10907-h/10907-h.htm#c25 21.25]}} These had established diplomatic contact with the Carthaginians and joined them as allies against their common enemy, Rome. The first objective of the insurgents were the Roman colonies of [[Placentia, Italy|Placentia]] and [[Cremona]], causing the Romans to flee to [[Mutina]] (modern Modena), which the Gauls then besieged. In response, [[Praetor]] [[L. Manlius Vulso]] marched with two [[Roman legion|legions]] and allies, for a total of 1,600 cavalry and 20,000 infantry, to [[Cisalpine Gaul]]. This army was ambushed twice on the way from [[Rimini|Ariminium]], losing 1,200 men; although the siege of Mutina was raised, the army itself fell under a loose siege a few kilometers from Mutina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first= Adrian|title= The Fall of Carthage|page= 151| isbn = 0-304-36642-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event prompted the [[Roman Senate]] to send one of Scipio's legions and 5,000 allied troops to aid Vulso. Scipio had to raise fresh troops to replace these and thus could not set out for Iberia until September 218 BC, giving Hannibal time to march from the Ebro to the Rhone.\nAfter evading a pitched battle at the Rhone, Hannibal came to the aid of his Gallic allies, who were hard pressed by the Roman reinforcements. He crossed the Alps, surmounting the difficulties of climate and terrain,&lt;ref name=mahaney2008 /&gt; and the [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] of the native tribes. His exact route is disputed. Hannibal arrived with at least 28,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry and 30 elephants in the territory of the [[Taurini]], in what is now [[Piedmont]], northern Italy. While this crossing was expected by the Romans, they had not anticipated such an early arrival and their forces were still in their winter quarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy&quot; /&gt;{{rp|[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10907/10907-h/10907-h.htm#c32 21.32–38]}} This crossing is credited as one of the greatest achievements in military logistics, as he crossed the Alps through hostile territory in late autumn with no supply line. His surprise entry into the Italian peninsula led to the termination of Rome's main intended thrust, an invasion of Africa.\nThe Gauls of the lower [[Po River|Po Valley]], Hannibal's allies, were still far away. Hannibal was first obliged to fight with his currently reduced force to be able to reach them and to incite the rest of [[Gallia Cisalpina]] to revolt. His first action was to take the chief city of the hostile [[Taurini]]. Afterwards, the Carthaginians were intercepted by a newly raised Roman force under [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]], whom Hannibal had evaded earlier in the [[Rhone]] Valley, and who had not anticipated such an early arrival on the other side of the Alps. In the ensuing [[Battle of Ticinus]], the cavalry forces of Hannibal's army defeated the cavalry and light infantry of the Romans in a minor engagement. Scipio, severely injured in the battle, retreated across the [[Trebbia|River Trebia]] with his heavy infantry still intact, and encamped at the town of [[Piacenza|Placentia]] to await reinforcements. As a result of Rome's defeat at the Ticinus, all the Gauls except the [[Cenomani]] were induced to join the Carthaginian cause. Soon, the entire north of Italy was unofficially insurgent, with both Gallic and Ligurian troops bolstering Hannibal's army back to at least 40,000 men.\n[[Image:Battle trebia.gif|thumb|right|300px|[[Battle of the Trebia]] plan.\n{{legend|#000088|Carthaginians}}\n{{legend|#ee0000|Romans}}]]\nEven before news of the defeat at the [[Ticino River|Ticinus River]] had reached Rome, the Senate had ordered the consul [[Sempronius Longus]] to bring his army back from Sicily, where it had been preparing for the invasion of Africa, to join Scipio and face Hannibal. The latter was blocking Sempronius' way to Scipio's army. However, the Carthaginian capture of the supply depot at [[Clastidium]], through the treachery of the local [[Latins|Latin]] commander, served as a diversion and allowed Sempronius' army to slip through to Scipio, who was still too seriously injured to take the field. After some minor successes, the united and numerically equal Roman force under the command of Sempronius Longus was lured into combat by Hannibal at the [[battle of the Trebia]]. The Roman troops were drawn into the engagement without breakfast and first had to cross a cold river, preventing many from putting up much of a fight. Furthermore, a hidden detachment led by Hannibal's younger brother [[Mago (Barcid)|Mago]] attacked them from the rear. All in all, the Romans suffered heavy losses with only 20,000 men out of 40,000 able to retreat to safety. They left Cisalpine Gaul in the aftermath. Having secured his position in northern Italy by this victory, Hannibal quartered his troops for the winter amongst the Gauls. The latter joined his army in large numbers, bringing it up to 60,000 men; however, their enthusiasm was somewhat reduced due to the Carthaginians living on their land.\nThe Roman Senate resolved to raise new armies against Hannibal under the recently elected consuls of 217 BC, [[Gnaeus Servilius Geminus]] and [[Gaius Flaminius Nepos]]. The latter had long distrusted his fellow senators and feared that they would try to sabotage his command by finding excuses to delay his departure. So he quietly left Rome to take over his army at [[Ariminum]] without performing the lengthy religious rituals required of an incoming [[Roman consul|consul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy&quot; /&gt;{{rp|[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10907/10907-h/10907-h.htm#c63 21.63]}} The Senate voted unanimously to recall him, but he ignored its orders. This caused widespread dismay among the Romans, who feared that Flaminius' disrespect for the gods would bring disaster on Rome. As it was expected that Hannibal would advance into central Italy, Flaminius moved his army from Ariminum to [[Arretium]], to cover the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennine]] mountain passes into [[Etruria]]. His colleague Servilius, who had performed the proper rituals and was therefore well behind Flaminius, replaced him with his freshly raised army at Ariminum to cover the route along the [[Adriatic]] coast. A third force, containing the survivors of previous engagements, was also stationed in Etruria under Scipio. Thus both the eastern and western routes to Rome appeared guarded.\n[[Image:Battle of lake trasimene.gif|300px|right|thumb|[[Battle of Lake Trasimene]] plan\n{{legend|#000088|Carthaginians}}\n{{legend|#ee0000|Romans}}]]\nIn early spring 217 BC, Hannibal decided to advance, leaving his wavering Gallic allies in the Po Valley and crossing the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] unopposed. Afterwards, he avoided the Roman positions and took the only unguarded route into [[Etruria]] at the mouth of the [[Arno]]. This route was through a huge marsh, which happened to be more flooded than usual for spring. Hannibal's army marched for several days without finding convenient places to rest, suffering terribly from fatigue and lack of sleep. This led to the loss of part of the force, including, it seems, the few remaining elephants.\nArriving in Etruria, still in the spring of 217 BC, Hannibal tried without success to draw the main Roman army under Flaminius into a [[pitched battle]] by devastating the area the latter had been sent to protect.&lt;ref name=&quot;hart&quot;&gt;[[B. H. Liddell Hart|Liddell Hart, B. H.]], ''Strategy'', New York City, New York, Penguin Group, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Then a new [[:wikt:stratagem|stratagem]] was employed by Hannibal, who marched around his opponent’s left flank and effectively cut him off from Rome. Advancing through the uplands of Etruria, the Carthaginian now provoked Flaminius into a hasty pursuit without proper reconnaissance. Then, in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] on the shore of [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimenus]], Hannibal lay in ambush with his army. The ambush was a complete success: in the [[battle of Lake Trasimene]] Hannibal destroyed most of the Roman army and killed Flaminius with little loss to his own army. 6,000 Romans had been able to escape, but were caught and forced to surrender by [[Maharbal]]'s Numidians. Furthermore, Scipio, aware of the fighting, sent his cavalry in support but it was also caught and annihilated. As a result of this victory, the heterogeneous force of insurgent Gauls, Africans, Iberians and Numidians had more military equipment than they could use themselves and sold the surplus via [[Egypt]]ian traders to the Romans. Like after all previous engagements, the captured enemies were sorted according to whether they were Romans, who were held captive, or non-Romans, who were released to spread the propaganda that the Carthaginian army was in Italy to fight for their freedom against the Romans. Strategically, Hannibal had now disposed of the only field force that could check his advance on Rome; but, despite the urgings of his generals, he did not proceed to attack Rome. Instead, he marched to the south in the hope of winning over allies amongst the [[Magna Graecia|Greek]] and [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic]] population there.\n====Fabian strategy====\n{{Main|Fabian strategy}}\n[[Image:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Detail of frieze showing the equipment of a soldier in the [[maniple (military unit)|manipular]] Roman legion (left).

Roman cavalry was levied from the ''[[Equestrian order|equites]]'', or noble knights, until c. 338 BC and thereafter also from the First Class of commoners under the [[centuria]]te organisation. Bronze ''[[Quincunx (Roman coin)|quincunx]]'' from [[Larinum]] mint]]\nThe defeat at Lake Trasimene put the Romans in an immense state of panic, fearing for the very existence of their city. The Senate decided to resort to the traditional emergency measure of appointing a ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'', a temporary commander-in-chief who would unite military authority, which was normally divided between the two consuls, under one head for six months. The usual procedure required the presence of a consul to appoint the ''dictator''. Since one consul (Flaminius) was dead and the other (Servilius) away with the only army left in Italy, the Senate resolved to elect a dictator itself. As this was unconstitutional, the person appointed, [[Fabius Maximus|Quintus Fabius Maximus]], was given the title of ''[[Roman dictator#Replacement of the dictatorate|prodictator]]'' (acting dictator) although he held the same powers as a dictator. The Senate also appointed his ''[[magister equitum]]'' (&quot;master of cavalry&quot;, who acted as his second-in-command) instead of allowing the dictator to choose one himself as was the normal rule: [[Marcus Minucius Rufus (consul 221 BC)|M. Minucius Rufus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy&quot; /&gt;{{rp|[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10907/10907-h/10907-h.htm#d8 22.8]}}\nDeparting from the Roman military tradition of engaging the enemy in pitched battle as soon as possible, Fabius invented the [[Fabian strategy]]: refusing open battle with his opponent, but constantly skirmishing with small detachments of the enemy. This course was not popular among the soldiers, earning Fabius the nickname Cunctator (&quot;delayer&quot;), since he seemed to avoid battle while Italy was being ravaged by the enemy. Moreover, it was widely feared that, if Hannibal continued to plunder Italy unopposed, the terrified allies, believing that Rome was incapable of protecting them, might defect and pledge their allegiance to the Carthaginians. As a countermeasure, residents of villages were encouraged to post lookouts, so that they could gather their livestock and possessions in time and take refuge in fortified towns that the enemy could not yet take. Fabius' policy was to shadow Hannibal by moving on the heights parallel to the Carthaginian movements on the plains, to avoid Hannibal's cavalry which was supreme on flat terrain. This demanded great care, since the Carthaginian tried with all his skill to ambush the Romans. For this reason, a new marching formation, with three parallel columns of infantry, was developed instead of the single column that had been in use at Lake Trasimene.\nFabius' constant harassment of Hannibal's force handicapped the latter's command abilities and gained many prisoners. Both commanders decided that they would exchange prisoners under the same conditions as in the [[First Punic War]]. Although the Carthaginians returned to the Romans several hundred more prisoners than they received and were thus expecting monetary compensation, the Senate was reluctant to pay. However, the estates of Fabius had not been touched by the Carthaginian pillage parties in order to incite distrust against him. Fabius now sold these estates to pay the enemy army for the received surplus of prisoners.\nHaving ravaged [[Apulia]] without provoking Fabius into a battle, Hannibal decided to march through [[Samnium]] to [[Campania]], one of the richest and most fertile provinces of Italy, hoping that the devastation would draw Fabius into battle. The latter was aware that there were excellent opportunities to trap the Carthaginian force on the Campanian plain and to force Hannibal to fight in the surrounding mountains on ground of his own choice. As the year wore on, Hannibal decided that it would be unwise to winter in the already devastated plains of Campania but Fabius had ensured that all the mountain passes offering an exit were blocked. This situation led to the [[Battle of Ager Falernus|night battle of Ager Falernus]] in which the Carthaginians made good their escape by tricking the Romans into believing that they were heading to the heights above them. The Romans were thus decoyed and the Carthaginians slipped through the undefended pass with all their baggage train. This was a severe blow to Fabius’ prestige.\nMinucius, the ''magister equitum'', was one of the leading voices in the army against the adoption of the Fabian Strategy. As soon as he scored a minor success, by winning a skirmish with the Carthaginians, the Senate promoted Minucius to the same ''[[imperium]]'' (power of command) as Fabius, whom he accused of cowardice. In consequence, the two men decided to split the army between them. Minucius' division was swiftly lured into an ambush by Hannibal in the flat country of [[Battle of Geronium|Geronium]]. Fabius Maximus rushed to his co-commander's assistance and Hannibal's forces immediately retreated. Subsequently, Minucius accepted Fabius' authority and ended their political conflict.\n====Seeking a decisive engagement====\n{{Main|Battle of Cannae}}\nFabius became unpopular in Rome, since his tactics did not lead to a quick end to the war. The Roman populace derided the ''Cunctator'', and at the elections of 216 BC elected as consuls [[Gaius Terentius Varro]] who advocated pursuing a more aggressive war strategy and [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], who advocated a strategy in the middle between the Fabian tactics and the tactics suggested by Varro.\nIn the campaign of 217 BC, Hannibal had failed to obtain a following among the [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italics]]. In the spring of 216 BC, he took the initiative and seized the large supply depot at [[Cannae]] in the Apulian plain. Thus, by seizing Cannae, Hannibal had placed himself between the Romans and their crucial source of supply. The Roman Senate authorised the raising of double-sized armies by the consuls Varro and Aemilius Paullus. By some estimates, the Romans raised a force as large as 100,000 men, though this figure cannot be completely validated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n[[Image:Battle of Cannae, 215 BC - Initial Roman attack.gif|right|thumb|400px|Opening and decisive phase of the [[Battle of Cannae]], 216 BC. The Punic cavalry (made up of Gauls and Iberians) routed the much weaker Roman cavalry on the Roman right wing, then raced round the rear of the Roman line to attack from behind the Romans' allied Latin cavalry on the Roman left, who were already engaged with Hannibal's Numidian horse. The Latin cavalry was then destroyed. The victorious Punic cavalry was then free to attack the Roman infantry line from the rear. The battle confirmed the superiority of Hannibal's cavalry, in both numbers and training, over the Roman and Latin citizen levies. From this time, the Romans relied heavily on non-Italian allied cavalry and, around the start of the 1st century BC, legionary cavalry was abolished altogether]]\nThe consuls Aemilius Paullus and Varro resolved to confront Hannibal and marched southward to [[Apulia]]. After a two-day march, they found him on the left bank of the [[Aufidus River]], and encamped ten kilometres (6 miles) away. Hannibal capitalized on Varro's eagerness and drew him into a trap by using an [[envelopment]] tactic that eliminated the Roman numerical advantage by shrinking the surface area where combat could occur. Hannibal drew up his least reliable infantry in the centre of a semicircle, with the wings composed of the Gallic and Numidian horse. The Roman legions forced their way through Hannibal's weak centre, but the Libyan Mercenaries on the wings swung around their advance, menacing their flanks. The onslaught of Hannibal's cavalry was irresistible, and the cavalry commander [[Hasdrubal, commander of the service corps|Hasdrubal]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy&quot; /&gt;{{rp|[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10907/10907-h/10907-h.htm#d46 22.45]}}&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D114 3.114]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Theodore Ayrault (1891).

As a result, the Roman army was surrounded with no means of escape. Due to these brilliant tactics, Hannibal, with much inferior numbers, managed to destroy all but a small remnant of this force. Depending on the source, it is estimated that 50,000–70,000 Romans were killed or captured at Cannae.\nAs [[Livy]] notes, &quot;How much more serious was the defeat of Cannae, than those which preceded it can be seen by the behaviour of Rome’s allies; before that fateful day, their loyalty remained unshaken, now it began to waver for the simple reason that they despaired of Roman power.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy&quot; /&gt;{{rp|[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10907/10907-h/10907-h.htm#d61 22.61]}}&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Mark, ''Cannae: Hannibal Smashes Rome's Army'', Steerling Heights, Missouri, Osprey&lt;/ref&gt; During that same year, the Greek cities in Sicily were induced to revolt against Roman political control, while the Macedonian king, [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] [[Macedonian–Carthaginian Treaty|pledged his support]] to Hannibal &amp;ndash; thus initiating the [[First Macedonian War]] against Rome. Hannibal also secured an alliance with newly appointed King [[Hieronymous]] of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], and [[Taranto|Tarentum]] also came over to him around that time. Hannibal now had the resources and personnel needed to launch a successful attack on the City of Rome. However, he was uncertain of the feasibility of such an attack and spent a great deal of time pondering it. While he hesitated, the Romans were able to regroup, and the opportunity was lost. The Romans looked back on Hannibal's indecision as what saved Rome from certain defeat. The only other notable event of 216 BC was the defection of [[Capua]], the second largest city of Italy, which Hannibal made his new base. Yet, even this defection failed to satisfy him as only a few of the Italian city-states that he had expected to gain as allies agreed to join him. Furthermore, the Macedonian navy was no match for the Roman navy, so they were unable to help him directly.\nHannibal sent a delegation to Rome to negotiate a peace and another one offering to release his Roman prisoners of war for ransom, but Rome rejected all offers.\n====Establishing a Carthaginian alliance in Italy====\n:''For a detailed analysis of Hannibal's relations with Roman allies, see: [[Socii#2nd Punic War|Socii]]''\n[[Image:RomaViaAppiaAntica03.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A well-preserved stretch of the [[Via Appia]], the first major [[Roman road]] in Italy. Construction was launched under the [[Roman censor|censor]] [[Appius Claudius]] in 312 BC and continued in stages until 269 BC when it reached its final destination, the port of [[Brindisi|Brundisium]]. It was the road used by Rome's armies, including Fabius', to reach Hannibal in S. Italy 216-203 BC]]\n[[Image:Via Appia map.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Trace of the [[Via Appia]] imposed on a satellite picture of southern Italy, showing the location of many of the Greek cities fought over by Hannibal and the Romans. The original Via Appia is in white. The alternative road (in pink) was constructed 400 years later under emperor [[Trajan]] (ruled 98-117). But the route was already a busy one in Hannibal's time and repeatedly used by him]]\nAfter Cannae, several south Italian allies immediately went over to Hannibal: the [[Apulia]]n towns of [[Salapia]], [[Arpi]] and [[Herdonia]] and many of the [[Lucania]]ns. Mago marched south with an army detachment and, some weeks later, the [[Bruttian]]s joined him. Simultaneously, Hannibal marched north with part of his forces and was joined by the [[Hirpini]] and the [[Caudini]], two of the three [[Samnium|Samnite]] cantons. The greatest gain was the second largest city of Italy, [[Capua]], when Hannibal's army marched into [[Campania]] in 216 BC. The inhabitants of Capua held limited Roman citizenship and the aristocracy was linked to the Romans via marriage and friendship, but the possibility of becoming the supreme city of Italy after the evident Roman disasters proved too strong a temptation. The treaty between them and Hannibal can be described as an agreement of friendship, since the Capuans had no obligations, but provided the harbour through which Hannibal was reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyos 122f&lt;/ref&gt;\nBy 215 BC, Hannibal's alliance system covered the bulk of southern Italy, save for the [[Magna Graecia|Greek cities]] along the coast (except [[Crotone|Croton]] that was conquered by his allies), [[Rhegium]], and the Latin colonies [[Benevento|Beneventum]], [[Lucera|Luceria]] in [[Samnium]], [[Venusia]] in Apulia, [[Brundisium]] and [[Paestum]]. The independent Gaul he had established in northern Italy was still out of Roman control.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyos 132&lt;/ref&gt;\nHannibal had been able to win over a major allied base by his tremendous military success. He also regarded it as essential to take the city of [[Nola]], a Roman fortress in Campania, a region that linked his various allies geographically and contained his most important harbour for supply. Prior to his first attempt, the pro-Punic faction in the city had been eliminated by the Romans, so there was no chance of the city being betrayed. Hannibal tried three times, by assault or siege, to take this city, which was defended by [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] in the [[Battle of Nola (216 BC)]], [[Battle of Nola (215 BC)]] and [[Battle of Nola (214 BC)]], but failed each time. At least in 215 Hannibal was able to take [[Casilinum]], the other important site for controlling Campania.\nWhile it was not directly connected with the Italian peninsula, [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] on [[Sicily]] was important for securing the sea routes for supply, since [[Lilybaeum]] remained in Roman hands. Hannibal was aided by the fact that [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], the old tyrant of Syracuse and a staunch Roman ally, had died and his successor [[Hieronymus of Syracuse|Hieronymus]] was discontented with his position in the Roman alliance. Hannibal dispatched two of his lieutenants, who were of Syracusian origin; they succeeded in winning Syracuse over, at the price, however, of making the whole of Sicily a Syracusan possession. The Syracusans' ambitions were great, but the army they fielded was no match for the arriving Roman force, leading to the [[Siege of Syracuse (214–212 BC)|Siege of Syracuse]] from 214 BC onwards. During this siege, the ingenuity of [[Archimedes]]' machines defeated all Roman attacks.\nThe essence of Hannibal's campaign in Italy was to fight the Romans by using local resources and raising recruits from among the local population. His subordinate Hanno was able to raise troops in [[Samnium]], but the Romans intercepted these new levies in the [[Battle of Beneventum (214 BC)]] and eliminated them before they came under the feared leadership of Hannibal. Hannibal could win allies, but defending them against the Romans was a new and difficult problem, as the Romans could still field multiple armies greatly outnumbering his own forces. Thus Fabius was able to take the Punic ally [[Arpi]] in 213 BC.\n===Eastern Mediterranean and Ionian Sea (218–213 BC)===\n{{Main|First Macedonian War}}\n* 217 BC – letter from Hannibal after [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]] leading to war preparations\n* 217–216 BC – [[Philip V of Macedon]] building a fleet of 100 [[lembus|lembi]]\n* 216 BC – ambassadors to Hannibal after [[Battle of Cannae]]\n* 214 BC – [[First Macedonian War]] officially starts\n* 214 BC – naval expeditions from Macedonia\n* 213 BC – land expedition to Lissus\n== Rome takes key cities (212–207 BC) ==\n===Western Mediterranean (212–207 BC)===\n====Defeat of the first expedition====\nIn Iberia, the Scipio brothers had hired 20,000 Celtiberian mercenaries to reinforce their army of 30,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry. Observing that the Carthaginian armies were deployed separately from each other, with Hasdrubal Barca and 15,000 troops near Amtorgis, and Mago Barca and Hasdrubal Gisco, both with 10,000 troops, further to the west of Hasdrubal, the Scipio brothers planned to split their forces. [[Publius Scipio]] decided to take 20,000 Roman and allied soldiers and attack Mago Barca near [[Castulo]], while [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus|Gnaeus Scipio]] took one double legion (10,000 troops) and the mercenaries to attack Hasdrubal Barca. This stratagem resulted in 2 battles, the [[Battle of Castulo]] and the [[Battle of Ilorca]], which occurred within a few days of each other, usually combined as the [[Battle of the Upper Baetis]] (211 BC). Both battles ended in clear defeats for the Romans because Hasdrubal bribed the Roman mercenaries to desert and return home without a fight.\nAs a result of the battle, the Romans were forced to retreat to their stronghold of Northern Iberia, from which the Carthaginians could not expel them. It is notable that the Roman soldiers decided to elect a new leader, since both commanders had been killed, a practice hitherto known only in Punic or Hellenistic armies.\n====Second Roman expedition to Iberia====\nIn 210 BC, Scipio Africanus arrived in Iberia on the Senate's orders to avenge his father and uncle.\nIn a brilliant assault in 209 BC, Scipio succeeded in capturing [[Battle_of_Cartagena_(209_BC)|Cartago Nova]], which was the centre of Punic power in Iberia. He defeated Hasdrubal in the [[Battle of Baecula]] (208 BC), but was not able to prevent him from continuing his march to Italy in order to reinforce his brother Hannibal.\nIn the [[Battle of Ilipa]] (206 BC), Scipio defeated a combined army under the command of [[Mago Barca]], [[Hasdrubal Gisgo]] and [[Masinissa]], thus bringing to an end the Carthaginian hold in Iberia.\n===Central Mediterranean (212–207 BC)===\n====Climax and fall of Hannibal's alliance====\n[[Image:Tarentum Hannibal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Coin issued by the city of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] during the period of Hannibal's control c. 212–208 BC showing (obverse) youth on horseback and (reverse) boy riding dolphin, the traditional symbol of Tarentine coins.

Silver ''[[didrachm]]'']]\n[[Image:Tomba archimede.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Ancient Greek tomb at [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], Sicily, believed to be that of [[Archimedes]] (with decorative lintel)]]\nThe climax of Carthaginian expansion was reached when the biggest Greek city in Italy, [[Taranto|Tarentum]], switched sides in 212 BC. The [[Battle of Tarentum (212 BC)]] was a carefully planned coup by Hannibal and members of the city's democratic faction. There were two separate successful assaults on the gates of the city. This enabled the Punic army, which had approached unobserved behind a screen of marauding Numidian horsemen, to enter the city by surprise and take all but the citadel where the Romans and their supporting faction were able to rally. The Carthaginians failed to take the citadel, but subsequent fortifications around this enemy stronghold enabled the city to remain under Punic control. However, the harbour was blocked and warships had to be transported overland to be launched at sea.\nThe [[Battle of Capua (212 BC)]] was a stalemate, since neither side could defeat the other. The Romans decided to withdraw and broke off the siege of Capua. As a result, the Capuan cavalry was reinforced with half of the available Numidian cavalry, 2,000 riders.\nIn the [[Battle of Beneventum (212 BC)]], Hanno the Elder was again defeated, this time by [[Quintus Fulvius Flaccus]], who also captured his camp. The following battle was the [[Battle of the Silarus]], in the same year, where the Romans under Marcus Centenius were ambushed and lost all but 1,000 of their 16,000 effectives. Also, in 212 BC, the [[Battle of Herdonia (212 BC)|Battle of Herdonia]] resulted in another Roman defeat, with only 2,000 Romans out of a force of 18,000 surviving a direct attack by Hannibal's numerically superior forces, combined with an ambush cutting off the Roman line of retreat.\nThis phase of the war was marked by the fall of major and minor cities to the Romans, although Hannibal was still able to prevail on the battlefield and thus lift some sieges. The [[Siege of Syracuse (214–212 BC)|Siege of Syracuse]], from 214 BC onwards, was marked by Archimedes' ingenuity in inventing war machines that made it impossible for the Romans to make any gains with traditional methods of siege warfare. A Carthaginian army of 20,000 had been sent to relieve the city, but suffered more heavily than the Romans from pestilence and was thus forced to retreat to Agrigentum. The fall of Syracuse was finally achieved by a Roman attack that was treacherously helped to enter the city by a Syracusan pro-Roman faction and resulted in the death of Archimedes.\n[[Image:Servian Wall.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A section of Rome's [[Servian Wall]] at [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]] railway station. It was this wall that dissuaded Hannibal from attempting a direct attack on Rome.]]\nIn the [[Battle of Capua (211 BC)]], Hannibal again tried to relieve his main harbour as in the previous year, by luring the Romans into a pitched battle. He was unsuccessful, and was also unable to lift the siege by assaulting the besiegers' defences. So he tried a strategem of staging a march towards Rome, hoping in this way to compel the enemy to abandon the siege and rush to defend their home city. However, only part of the besieging force left for Rome and, under continued siege, Capua fell soon afterwards. Near Rome he fought another pitched battle.\nThe [[Battle of Herdonia (210 BC)]] was another battle to lift the Roman siege of an allied city. Hannibal caught the proconsul [[Gnaeus Fulvius Centumalus Maximus|Gnaeus Fulvius Centumalus]] off guard during his siege of Herdonia and destroyed his army in a pitched battle with up to 13,000 Romans dead out of less than 20,000. The defection of Salapia in Apulia in 210 BC was achieved by treachery: the inhabitants massacred the Numidian garrison and went over to the Romans.\nIn 210 BC, the [[Battle of Numistro]] between Marcellus and Hannibal was inconclusive, but the Romans stayed on his heels until the also inconclusive [[Battle of Canusium]] in 209 BC. In the meantime, this battle enabled another Roman army under Fabius to approach Tarentum and take it by treachery in the [[Battle of Tarentum (209 BC)]]. Hannibal, at that time, had been able to disengage from Marcellus and was only {{convert|5|mi|km|disp=flip|abbr=on}} away when the city, under the command of Carthalo (who was bound to Fabius by an agreement of hospitality), fell.\n====Hasdrubal's failed reinforcement====\nThe [[Battle of Grumentum]] was an inconclusive fight in 207 BC between [[Gaius Claudius Nero]] and Hannibal. In the aftermath of the battle, Nero was able to trick Hannibal into believing that the whole Roman army was still in camp. In the meantime, Nero marched with a selected corps north and reinforced the Romans there to win the [[Battle of the Metaurus]], killing [[Hasdrubal (Barcid)|Hasdrubal]] and scattering the survivors of his army. The Carthaginian force under Hasdrubal had left Iberia a year before, after the defeat at the [[Battle of Baecula]] and had been reinforced by Gallic and Ligurian mercenaries and allies. It is notable that they took the same route as Hannibal 10 years previously, but suffered fewer casualties, being better supported by mercenaries from the mountain tribes.\n====Naval raids and expeditions====\n* 210 BC – second expedition to Sardinia\n* 210 BC – naval expedition to Tarentum\n* 210 BC – Roman raids on Africa\n===Eastern Mediterranean and Ionian Sea (212–207 BC)===\n{{Main|First Macedonian War}}\nIn 211 BC, Rome countered the Macedonian threat with a Greek alliance of the [[Aetolian League|Aetolian]]s, [[Elis]], [[Sparta]], [[Messenia]] and [[Attalus I]] of [[Pergamon]], as well as two Roman clients, the [[Illyrians]] [[Pleuratus]] and [[Scerdilaidas]].&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Liv.%2026.40.4&amp;lang=original XXVI.40].

Scipio Africanus Major employed a clever ruse. Every day for several days, he drew up his army for battle with the Romans stationed in the centre of the line and the Iberians on the wings. But when the enemy offered battle, he would eventually decline it. By this stratagem, he convinced the Punic commanders [[Mago (Barcid)|Mago]] and [[Hasdrubal Gisco]] that they could expect the Romans to hold the centre of their line. On the day of the battle, the Roman force deployed earlier in the day and with the Romans posted on the wings of the line. In the rush to respond, the Carthaginians placed their best forces in the centre as usual, failing to spot the unusual Roman deployment. Thus the inferior Carthaginian mercenaries on the wings were severely beaten by the Romans. The Celtiberians deserted the Carthaginian camp that night. This catastrophic defeat sealed the fate of the Carthaginian presence in Iberia. It was followed by the Roman capture of [[Gades]] in 206 BC after the city had already rebelled against Carthaginian rule. The Tribal leaders [[Indibilis]] and [[Mandonius]] (of the [[Ausetani]]) thought that, after the expulsion of the Carthaginians, the Romans would leave and they would get control of Spain again. This didn't happen, however, so they participated with the [[Mutiny at Sucro|mutineers at the Sucro camp]] against the Romans. However, this mutiny was ultimately squelched by Scipio Africanus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy2&quot;&gt;[[Livy]]. ''The History of Rome by Titus Livius: Books Twenty-Seven to Thirty-Six,'' trans.

So, in the same year, he left Iberia, setting sail from the [[Balearic islands]] to Italy with his remaining forces.\n====The Numidian struggle====\n[[Image:Tomb of Massinissa 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tomb of the Numidian king [[Massinissa]] (c. 238–c. 148 BC). Massinissa, leader of the Massyli tribe, was originally an ally of Carthage and fought against the Romans in Iberia. But, after the [[Battle of Ilipa]] in 206 BC, he switched sides. His support at the [[Battle of Zama]] was critical to the Roman victory. Massinissa remained a staunch Roman ally for the rest of his long life. Site: Shoumaa el-Khroub, near [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], Algeria]]\nIn 206 BC, there was a quick succession of kings in Eastern [[Numidia]] that temporarily ended with the division of the land between Carthage and the Western Numidian king [[Syphax]], a former Roman ally. For this bargain, Syphax was to marry [[Sophonisba]], daughter of [[Hasdrubal Gisco]]. [[Massinissa]], who had thus lost his [[fiancee]], went over to the Romans with whom he had already established contact during his military service in Iberia.\n===Central Mediterranean (206–202 BC)===\n====Carrying the war to Africa====\n{{Main|Battle of Utica (203 BC)|Battle of the Great Plains}}\nIn 205, Mago landed in [[Genoa|Genua]] by sea the remnants of his Spanish army. This was the third Carthaginian force invading Italy. It soon received Gallic and Ligurian reinforcements. Mago's arrival in the north of the Italian peninsula was followed by Hannibal's [[Battle of Crotona]] in 204 in the south of the peninsula. Mago's reinforced army's march towards the lands of the Boii and Insubres, Carthage's main Gallic allies and a place of retreat for Hasdrubal's defeated remnants, was checked by the Romans in the [[Po Valley Raid]] in 203. This hindered the third attempted invasion of Italy early in its tracks from uniting with Hannibal's army in the south. The split Carthaginian armies were less dangerous, allowing for Roman manpower to be directed to the invasion of Africa, despite the [[Damocles sword]] of the enemy troops on and around Roman lands.\nAt the same time, [[Scipio Africanus Major]] was given command of the legions in [[Sicily]] and was allowed to levy volunteers for his plan to end the war by an invasion of Africa. The legions in Sicily were mainly the survivors of Cannae, who were not allowed home until the war was finished. Scipio was also one of the survivors but, unlike the ordinary soldiers, had been allowed to return to Rome along with the other surviving [[Military_tribune|tribunes]], and had run successfully for public office and had been given command of the troops in Iberia.\nWithin a year of his landing in Africa, Scipio twice routed the regular Carthaginian forces, under [[Hasdrubal Gisco]], and his [[Numidia]]n allies. The main native supporter of the Carthaginians, king [[Syphax]] of the [[Masaesyli|Massaesylians]] (western Numidians), was defeated and taken prisoner. [[Masinissa]], a Numidian rival of Syphax and, at that time, an ally of the Romans, seized a large part of his kingdom with their help. These setbacks persuaded some of the Carthaginians that it was time to sue for peace. Others pleaded for the recall of the sons of [[Hamilcar Barca]], [[Hannibal]] and [[Mago (Barcid)|Mago]], who were still fighting the Romans in [[Bruttium]] and [[Cisalpine Gaul]] respectively.\nIn 203 BC, while [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] was carrying all before him in Africa and the Carthaginian peace party were arranging an [[armistice]], Hannibal was recalled from Italy by the war party at Carthage. After leaving a record of his expedition engraved in [[Punic language|Punic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] upon bronze tablets in the temple of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] at [[Crotone]], he sailed back to Africa. These records were later quoted by [[Polybius]]. Hannibal's arrival immediately restored the predominance of the war party, who placed him in command of a combined force of [[Africa]]n [[Conscription#Medieval levies|levies]] and his mercenaries from Italy. But Hannibal was opposed to this policy and tried to convince them not to send the untrained African levies into battle. In 202 BC, Hannibal met Scipio in a peace conference. Despite the two generals' mutual admiration, negotiations floundered, according to the Romans due to &quot;Punic faith&quot;, meaning bad faith. This Roman expression referred to the alleged breach of protocols which ended the [[First Punic War]] by the Carthaginian attack on Saguntum, Hannibal's perceived breaches of the idealised Roman military etiquette (i.e. Hannibal's numerous ambuscades), as well as the armistice violated by the Carthaginians in the period before Hannibal's return.\n====Broken armistice and final peace treaty====\n[[File:Schlacht bei Zama Gemälde H P Motte.jpg|thumb|left|Carthaginian war elephants engage Roman infantry at the Battle of Zama (202 BC).]]\n{{Main|Battle of Zama}}\nThe decisive battle soon followed. Unlike most battles of the Second Punic War, the Romans had superiority in cavalry and the Carthaginians had superiority in infantry. The Roman army was generally better armed and trained than the Carthaginians. Hannibal had refused to lead this army into battle, because he did not expect them to be able to stand their ground. There had been very bitter arguments between him and the oligarchy. His co-general, [[Hasdrubal Gisco]], was forced to commit suicide by a violent mob after he spoke in support of Hannibal's view that such troops should not be led into battle. Before the battle, Hannibal gave no speech to his new troops, only to his veterans.\nScipio countered an expected Carthaginian elephant charge, which caused some of Hannibal's elephants to turn back into his own ranks, throwing his cavalry into disarray. The Roman cavalry was able to capitalize on this and drive the Carthaginian cavalry from the field.\nHowever, the battle remained closely fought and, at one point, it seemed that Hannibal was on the verge of victory. However, Scipio was able to rally his men, and his cavalry returned from chasing the Carthaginian cavalry and attacked Hannibal's rear. This two-pronged attack caused the Carthaginian formation to disintegrate and collapse. After their defeat, [[Hannibal]] convinced the Carthaginians to accept peace. Notably, he broke the rules of the assembly by forcibly removing a speaker who supported continued resistance. Afterwards, he was obliged to apologize for his behaviour.\n===Eastern Mediterranean and Ionian Sea (218–201 BC)===\n{{Main|First Macedonian War}}\n* 206 BC – the Aetolians make peace with Macedonia\n* 205 BC – Rome lands with 11,000 men and 35 ships in [[Durrës]] but achieve no military objective\n* 205 BC – the [[First Macedonian war]] ends with the peace [[Treaty of Phoenice]]\n==Aftermath==\n[[Image:Carthage-1958-PortsPuniques.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Aerial view (1958) of Carthage's [[cothon]]-type military harbour.\nThe circular naval base was situated on the central peninsula.

Note the individual docking bays for warships.]]\nCarthage lost Hispania forever, and Rome firmly established her power there over large areas. Rome imposed a war indemnity of 10,000 [[talent (weight)|talents]] (300 [[tonne]]s/660,000 pounds), limited the Carthaginian navy to 10 ships (to ward off pirates), and forbade Carthage from raising an army without Roman permission. The Numidians took the opportunity to capture and plunder Carthaginian territory. Half a century later, when Carthage raised an army to defend itself from these incursions, Rome destroyed her in the [[Third Punic War]] (149-146 BC). Rome, on the other hand, by her victory, had taken a key step towards what ultimately became her domination of the [[Mediterranean]] world.\nThe end of the war did not meet with a universal welcome in Rome. When the Senate decreed upon a peace treaty with Carthage, [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus (died 175 BC)|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], a former consul, said he did not look upon the termination of the war as a blessing to Rome, since he feared that the Roman people would now sink back again into its former slumbers, from which it had been roused by the presence of Hannibal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]] vii. 2. §3.\n&lt;/ref&gt; Others, most notably [[Cato the Elder]], feared that if Carthage was not completely destroyed it would soon regain its power and pose new threats to Rome; he pressed for harsher peace-conditions. Even after the peace, Cato insisted on the destruction of Carthage, ending all his speeches with [[Carthago delenda est|&quot;Carthage must be destroyed&quot;]], even if they had nothing to do with Carthage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Major*.html Life of Cato]&lt;/ref&gt;\nArcheology has discovered that the famous circular military harbour at Carthage, the [[Cothon]], received a significant buildup during or after this war. Though shielded from external sight, it could house and quickly deploy about 200 [[triremes]]. This appears a surprising development as, after the war, one of the terms of surrender restricted the Carthaginian fleet to only ten triremes. One possible explanation: as has been pointed out for other Phoenician cities, [[privateer]]s with warships played a significant role besides trade, even when the Roman Empire was fully established and officially controlled all coasts. In this case it is not clear whether the treaty included private warships. The only reference to Punic privateers comes from the First Punic War: one such privateer, Hanno the Rhodian, owned a [[quinquereme]] (faster than the serial production models that the Romans had copied), manned with about 500 men and then among the heaviest warships in use. Later pirates in Roman waters are all reported with much smaller vessels, which could outrun naval vessels, but operated with lower personnel costs. Thus piracy was probably highly developed in Carthage and the state did not have a monopoly of military forces. Pirates probably played an important role in capturing slaves, one of the most profitable trade-goods, but merchant ships with tradeable goods and a crew were also their targets. No surviving source reports the fate of Punic privateers in the periods between and after the Punic Wars.\nHannibal became a [[businessman]] for several years and later enjoyed a leadership role in Carthage. However, the Carthaginian nobility, upset by his policy of democratisation and his struggle against corruption, persuaded the Romans to force him into exile in [[Asia Minor]], where he again led armies against the Romans and their allies on the battlefield. He eventually committed suicide (ca 182 BC) to avoid capture.\n==Carthage and Numidia after the war==\nConstant low-level warfare persisted between Carthage and Numidia, but, by the time of the [[Third Punic War]] (149-146 BC), Carthage had lost most of her African territories and the Numidians traded independently with the Greeks.\n==Intelligence==\nIn this conflict intelligence played an important role on both sides. Hannibal mastered an intelligence service that enabled him to achieve outstanding victories.&lt;ref&gt;Zlattner 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Scipio Africanus Major's victories depended on information. In 217 BC a Carthaginian resident spy in Rome -probably a Roman citizen - was caught and had his hands cut off as a punishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy&quot; /&gt;{{rp|[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10907/10907-h/10907-h.htm#d33 22.33.1]}}&lt;ref&gt;\nAustin&amp;Rankov 1995, p. 93\n&lt;/ref&gt;\n==Opinions on the war==\nAccording to [[Livy]] it was &quot;the most memorable of all wars that were ever waged: the war which the Carthaginians, under the conduct of Hannibal, maintained with the Roman people. For never did any states and nations more efficient in their resources engage in contest; nor had they themselves at any other period so great a degree of power and energy. They brought into action too no arts of war unknown to each other, but those which had been tried in the [[first Punic war]]; and so various was the fortune of the conflict, and so doubtful the victory, that they who conquered were more exposed to danger. The hatred with which they fought also was almost greater than their resources&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Livy&quot; /&gt;{{rp|[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10907/10907-h/10907-h.htm#c1 21.1]}}\n==In popular culture==\n*[[G.
