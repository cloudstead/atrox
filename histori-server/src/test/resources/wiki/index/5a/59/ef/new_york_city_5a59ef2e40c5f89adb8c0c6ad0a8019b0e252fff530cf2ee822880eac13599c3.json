Most of the borough is on Manhattan Island, at the mouth of the [[Hudson River]]. Several small islands are also part of the borough of Manhattan, including [[Randall's Island]], [[Wards Island]], and [[Roosevelt Island]] in the [[East River]], and [[Governors Island]] and [[Liberty Island]] to the south in [[New York Harbor]].

Uptown Manhattan is divided by Central Park into the [[Upper East Side]] and the [[Upper West Side]], and above the park is [[Harlem]].

In another feature called the low back chain shift, the {{IPA|[ɔ]}} vowel sound of words like ''talk'', ''law'', ''cross'', ''chocolate'', and ''coffee'' and the often [[homophonous]] {{IPA|[ɔr]}} in ''core'' and ''more'' are tensed and usually raised more than in [[General American]]. In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like &quot;girl&quot; and of words like &quot;oil&quot; became a diphthong {{IPA|[ɜɪ]}}. This would often be misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the ''er'' and ''oy'' sounds, so that ''girl'' is pronounced &quot;goil&quot; and ''oil'' is pronounced &quot;erl&quot;; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like &quot;Joizey&quot; (Jersey), &quot;Toidy-Toid Street&quot; (33rd St.) and &quot;terlet&quot; (toilet).&lt;ref name=NYT19930214/&gt; The character [[Archie Bunker]] from the 1970s sitcom ''[[All in the Family]]'' (played by [[Carroll O'Connor]]) was a notable example of having used this pattern of speech, which continues to fade in its overall presence.\n===Sports===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 = 2005 New York City Marathon.jpg\n| width1 = 225\n| caption1 = The [[New York City Marathon|New York Marathon]] is the largest marathon in the world.&lt;ref name = &quot;World's Largest Marathons&quot;/&gt;\n| alt1 = Three runners in a race down a street where onlookers are cheering behind barriers.\n| image2 = Arthur ashe stadium interior.jpg\n| width2 = 225\n| caption2 = The [[U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open Tennis Championships]] are held every August and September in [[Flushing Meadows-Corona Park]], Queens.\n| alt2 = A tennis stadium pack with fans watching a grass court.\n| image3 = Citi Field 2011.JPG\n| width3 = 225\n| caption3 = [[Citi Field]], also in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, has been home to the [[New York Mets]] since 2009.\n| alt3 = A baseball stadium from behind home plate in the evening.\n}}\n{{Main|Sports in New York City}}\nNew York City is home to the [[headquarters]] of the [[National Football League]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.National_Football_League.f36bd60db3fbcb01.html |title=National Football League Company Information |publisher=Hoover's, Inc |accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Major League Baseball]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.Major_League_Baseball.690243a73fc37ae4.html |title=Major League Baseball Company Information |publisher=Hoover's, Inc |accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Basketball Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.National_Basketball_Association_Inc.9752d99632cf8a45.html |title=National Basketball Association, Inc.
