The Western Addition is usually divided into smaller neighborhoods including [[Hayes Valley, San Francisco, California|Hayes Valley]], [[Fillmore District, San Francisco, California|the Fillmore]], and [[Japantown, San Francisco|Japantown]], which was once the largest Japantown in North America but suffered when its [[Japanese American]] residents were [[Japanese American internment|forcibly removed and interned]] during World War II. The Western Addition survived the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]] with its [[Victorian house|Victorians]] largely intact, including the famous &quot;[[Painted Ladies]]&quot;, standing alongside [[Alamo Square]].

The predominantly African American [[Hunters Point, San Francisco|Bayview-Hunters Point]] in the far southeast corner of the city is one of the poorest neighborhoods and suffers from a high rate of crime, though the area has been the focus of several revitalizing and controversial [[urban renewal]] projects.\nThe construction of the [[Twin Peaks Tunnel]] in 1918 connected southwest neighborhoods to downtown via streetcar, hastening the development of [[West Portal, San Francisco|West Portal]], and nearby affluent [[Forest Hill, San Francisco|Forest Hill]] and [[St. Francis Wood, San Francisco|St. Francis Wood]]. Further west, stretching all the way to the Pacific Ocean and north to [[Golden Gate Park]] lies the vast [[Sunset District, San Francisco|Sunset District]], a large middle class area with a predominantly Asian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news\n| last = Chow | first = Andrew\n| title = Dismal APA Turnout at First Redistricting Meetings\n| publisher=Asian Week\n| date = March 22, 2002\n}}&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe northwestern quadrant of the city contains the [[Richmond District, San Francisco|Richmond]], also a mostly middle-class neighborhood north of Golden Gate Park, home to immigrants from other parts of Asia as well as many [[Russian people|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] immigrants. Together, these areas are known as [[Neighborhoods in San Francisco|The Avenues]]. These two districts are each sometimes further divided into two regions: the Outer Richmond and Outer Sunset can refer to the more western portions of their respective district and the Inner Richmond and Inner Sunset can refer to the more eastern portions.\nMany piers remained derelict for years until the demolition of the [[Embarcadero Freeway]] reopened the downtown waterfront, allowing for redevelopment. The centerpiece of the port, the [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]], while still receiving commuter ferry traffic, has been restored and redeveloped as a gourmet marketplace. The port's other activities now focus on developing waterside assets to support recreation and tourism.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n===Climate===\nA popular quote incorrectly attributed to [[Mark Twain]] is &quot;The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;marktwain&quot;&gt;{{cite news\n| last = Nolte | first = Carl\n| title = Fog Heaven: The sun will come out tomorrow.

Cohen writes that many credit &quot;Friscophobia&quot; to newspaper columnist [[Herb Caen]], whose first book, published in 1953, was &quot;Don't Call it Frisco&quot; after a 1918 newspaper article of the same name. Caen was considered by many to be the recognized authority on what was, and what was not, beneath the city's dignity, and to him, Frisco was intolerable. {{cite web\n| last = Cohen | first = Sam\n| title = Locals know best: only tourists call it 'Frisco'\n| work = Golden Gater Online\n| publisher = San Francisco State University\n| date = September 11, 1997\n| url = http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/gater/fall97/sept11/Frisco.html\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19971123191158/http://www.journalism.sfsu.edu/www/pubs/gater/fall97/sept11/Frisco.html\n| archivedate=November 23, 1997\n| accessdate =July 13, 2008\n}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n&lt;ref name=&quot;The City that Knows How&quot;&gt;{{cite web\n| url = http://sfpl.org/index.php?pg=2000141201\n| title = PPIE: The City That Knows How\n| accessdate =June 14, 2008\n| work = Amusing America\n| publisher = San Francisco Public Library\n| date = March 29, 2005\n}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n&lt;ref name=&quot;Baghdad by the Bay&quot;&gt;{{cite book\n| last = Caen | first = Herb\n| authorlink = Herb Caen\n| title = Baghdad-by-the-Bay\n| publisher = Doubleday\n| year = 1949\n| location = Garden City, NY\n| id = LC F869.S3 C12\n| isbn = 978-0-89174-047-6\n| oclc = 31060237\n}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n&lt;ref name=&quot;The Paris of the West&quot;&gt;{{cite web\n| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jHvTZ1RL4I\n| title = The City\n| accessdate =June 5, 2009\n| work = UnknownWW2InColor\n| publisher = UnknownWW2InColor (Ramano-Archives)\n| year = 1939\n}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2010-GCT-PH1-density&quot;&gt;{{cite web\n| title = GCT-PH1 – Population, Housing Units, Area, and Density: 2010 – County – Census Tract\n| url = http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_SF1_GCTPH1.CY07\n| work = [[2010 United States Census]] Summary File 1\n| publisher = United States Census Bureau\n| accessdate =November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n}}\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n&lt;!-- Books &amp; Journals cited in the Notes section --&gt;\n*{{cite book\n|last=De La Perouse\n|first = Jean Francois\n|author2 = Yamane, Linda Gonsalves|author3=Margolin, Malcolm\n|title = Life in a California Mission: Monterey in 1786: The Journals of Jean Francois De La Perouse\n|year=1989\n|publisher=[[Heyday Books]]\n|isbn = 978-0-930588-39-7\n|oclc = 20368802 }}\n*{{cite book\n|last = Hansen\n|first = Gladys\n|title = San Francisco Almanac: Everything you want to know about the city\n|publisher=Chronicle Books\n|year = 1995\n|isbn = 978-0-8118-0841-5\n|oclc = 30702907}}\n*{{cite journal\n|last = London\n|first = Jack\n|title = The Story of an Eyewitness by Jack London\n|journal=Collier's, the National Weekly\n|date = May 5, 1906 }}\n*{{cite book\n|last = Richards\n|first = Rand\n|title = Historic San Francisco: A Concise History and Guide\n|publisher=Heritage House\n|year = 1991\n|isbn = 978-1-879367-00-5\n|oclc = 214330849 }}\n*{{cite book\n|last = Ungaretti\n|first = Lorri\n|title = San Francisco's Richmond District\n|publisher=Arcadia Publishing\n|year = 2005\n|isbn = 978-0-7385-3053-6\n|oclc = 62249656 }}\n*{{cite book | author=Wiley, Peter Booth | title=National trust guide San Francisco: America’s guide for architecture and history travelers | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-471-19120-9 | oclc=44313415}}\n{{Refend}}\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book | year= 1989 | publisher=Dorset Press | title=The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld | author=Asbury, Hubert | isbn=978-0-88029-428-7 | oclc= 22719465 }}\n*{{cite book | author=Bronson, William | title=The Earth Shook, the Sky Burned | publisher=Chronicle Books |year=2006 | isbn=978-0-8118-5047-6 | oclc=65223734 }}\n*{{cite book | year= 1987 | publisher=Square Books | title=Spanning the Gate | author=Cassady, Stephen | isbn=978-0-916290-36-8 | oclc= 15229396 }}\n*{{cite book | year= 1998 | publisher=Celestial Arts (Reissue edition) | title=High Steel: Building the Bridges Across San Francisco Bay | author=Dillon, Richard H. | isbn=978-0-88029-428-7 | oclc= 22719465 }}\n*{{ cite book | title=Literary San Francisco: A pictorial history from its beginnings to the present day | author=Ferlinghetti, Lawrence | isbn=978-0-06-250325-1 | year=1980 | publisher=Harper &amp; Row | oclc=6683688 }}\n*{{cite book | year=2002 | publisher=University of California Press | title=City for Sale: The Transformation of San Francisco | author=Hartman, Chester | isbn=978-0-520-08605-0 | oclc=48579085 }}\n*{{ cite book | title=Rush for Riches: Gold Fever and the Making of California | author=Holliday, J.
