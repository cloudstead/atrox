From the time that the earliest English-speaking settlers arrived, the area has also been known as ''The Forks'', because it is situated at the confluence of the north and south branches of the [[Kalamazoo River]]. The ''Festival of the Forks'' has been held annually since 1967 to celebrate Albion's ethnic heritage.\nThe presence of several major manufacturers since the 19th century has given Albion the reputation of a factory town. This has changed with the closure of several manufacturers, and Albion's culture is changing to that of a college town with a strong interest in technology and sustainability issues.  [[Albion College]] is a private liberal arts college with a student population of about 1,750. Albion is a [[sister city]] with [[Noisy-le-Roi]], France.\n==History==\nThe first European-American settler, Tenney Peabody, arrived in 1833 along with his brother-in-law Charles Blanchard, and a young man named Clark Dowling. Peabody's family followed soon after. In 1835, the Albion Company, a land development company formed by [[Jesse Crowell]], [[plat]]ted a village and Peabody's wife was asked to name the settlement. She considered the name &quot;Peabodyville&quot;, but &quot;Albion&quot; was selected instead, after the former residence of Jesse Crowell. Crowell became the first postmaster in 1838. Albion incorporated as a village in 1855 and as a city in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albionmich.com/history/histor_notebook/000910.shtml#TOP &quot;Festival of the Forks&quot;], Frank Passic, ''Morning Star'', September 10, 2000, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albionmich.com/history/histor_notebook/960909.shtml &quot;The Passing Scene&quot;], Frank Passic, ''Morning Star'', September 9, 2001, pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn 1835, [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist Episcopal]] settlers established [[Albion College]], which was known by a few other names before 1861 when the college was fully authorized to confer four-year degrees on both men and women. The first classes were held in Albion in 1843.\nThe forks of the Kalamazoo River provided power for [[Watermill|mills]], and Albion quickly became a mill town as well as an agricultural market. A railroad line arrived in 1852, fostering the development of other industries.\nIn 1973 Albion was named an [[All-America City Award|All-America City]] by the [[National Civic League]]. It celebrated winning the award on May 15, 1974 when the Governor of Michigan, [[William Milliken]], and many dignitaries came to town. However, in 1975 the closure of a major factory cut the celebration short and new challenges were created overnight.\nSince that time citizens have mobilized, with support from the Albion Community Foundation founded in 1968, and the Albion Volunteer Service Organization, founded in the 1980s with support from Albion College, to address the challenge of diminishing economic opportunity.\n[[Image:Superior Street Commercial Historic District.jpg|thumb|left|alt=\nA National Register Historic Site was established in 1997.| Albion's historic brick main street—first laid in 1903 and\nreconstructed with hand-laid, kiln-fired clay bricks in 1993.]]\n[[Freedom of the City|Key to the City Honor]] Bestowed:\n*1964: [[Aunt Jemima]] visited Albion on January 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albionmich.com/history/histor_notebook/070107.shtml |title=The Key To The City |publisher=Albionmich.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n*1960s: [[Ann Landers]] was presented with a key upon her visit to Starr Commonwealth for Boys.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;\n== Law and government ==\nAlbion has a [[Council-manager government|Council-Manager]] form of government. City residents elect a Mayor and City Council members from six districts. The council in turn selects a City Manager to handle day-to-day affairs of the city. The mayor presides over and is a voting member of the council. Council members are elected to four-year terms, staggered every two years. A mayor is elected every two years.\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.51|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|4.41|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.10|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name =&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albion is positioned 42.24 degrees north of the equator and 84.75 degrees west of the prime meridian.\n== Climate ==\n&lt;div style=&quot;width:75%&quot;&gt;\n{{Weather box |imperial first = Y\n|location = Albion\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high F = 33.6\n|Feb high F = 31.8\n|Mar high F = 41.6\n|Apr high F = 55.5\n|May high F = 70.0\n|Jun high F = 79.8\n|Jul high F = 85.6\n|Aug high F = 82.3\n|Sep high F = 74.2\n|Oct high F = 60.5\n|Nov high F = 44.0\n|Dec high F = 36.5\n|year high F=\n|Jan low F = 19.8\n|Feb low F = 17.2\n|Mar low F = 26.6\n|Apr low F = 38.3\n|May low F = 49.8\n|Jun low F = 59.6\n|Jul low F = 63.8\n|Aug low F = 61.3\n|Sep low F = 54.6\n|Oct low F = 43.0\n|Nov low F = 31.0\n|Dec low F = 24.8\n|year low F=\n|Jan precipitation inch = 2.0\n|Feb precipitation inch = 1.7\n|Mar precipitation inch = 2.4\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.2\n|May precipitation inch = 3.7\n|Jun precipitation inch = 3.7\n|Jul precipitation inch = 3.3\n|Aug precipitation inch = 3.1\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.3\n|Oct precipitation inch = 2.7\n|Nov precipitation inch = 2.6\n|Dec precipitation inch = 2.3\n|year precipitation inch=33.9\n|source 1 = Weatherbase &lt;ref name=Weatherbase&gt;\n{{cite web\n|url =http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=89357&amp;refer=wikipedia |title =Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Albion, Michigan\n|publisher=Weatherbase\n|year=2011\n}}\nRetrieved on November 24, 2011.\n&lt;/ref&gt;\n|date=November 2011\n}}\n&lt;/div&gt;\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 881\n|1880= 2716\n|1890= 3763\n|1900= 4519\n|1910= 5833\n|1920= 8354\n|1930= 8324\n|1940= 8345\n|1950= 10406\n|1960= 12749\n|1970= 12112\n|1980= 11059\n|1990= 10066\n|2000= 9144\n|2010= 8616\n|estyear=2014\n|estimate=8267\n|estref=&lt;ref name=&quot;USCensusEst2014&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2014/SUB-EST2014.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2014|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n|footnote=Source: Census Bureau.
