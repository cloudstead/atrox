Penna]], a mountain of the Apennines. It is 47&amp;nbsp;km  NE of [[Perugia]] and 30&amp;nbsp;km SE of [[Gubbio]].\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nGualdo has a long history and was originally an [[Umbrians|Umbrian]] village known as '''Tarsina'''. Conquered by the [[ancient Roman|Romans]] in 266 BC and re-christened '''Tadinum''', it was a station on the [[Via Flaminia]]. In 217 BC it was destroyed by [[Hannibal]]'s troops. A similar defeat was inflicted on it in 47 BC by [[Julius Caesar]] and in 410 AD by [[Alaric I|Alaric]]'s [[Visigoths]].\nIn 552, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] general [[Narses]] briefly restored Italy to the empire by defeating the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogoth]] king [[Baduila]] in what is now known as the [[Battle of Taginae]], the exact site of which is not known, but thought by most scholars to be a few kilometers from the town, in the plain to the west at a place called Taino. This suspicion may have received confirmation in 2004.\nThe ancient city survived that war, only to be destroyed in a later war at the instigation of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto III]] in 966. It was later rebuilt, only to be destroyed a second time by fire in 1237. Finally, the Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] ordered the city rebuilt for a third time in 1239, and it is this incarnation which survives today.\nGualdo Tadino sister cities are: [[West Pittston]], PA (USA) and Audun Le Tiche, France\n==Main sights==\n*[[Rocca Flea]], a 12th-century castle which is now the main monument of the town.\n*[[San Francesco, Gualdo Tadino|San Francesco]] (13th century), housing frescoes by [[Matteo da Gualdo]].\n*Church of ''Santa Chiara'' (13th century).\n*''Palazzo del Podest��''.\n*''Torre Civica'' (Town Tower).\n*[[Gualdo Tadino Cathedral]] (Church of St. Benedict), with an external fountain attributed to [[Antonio da Sangallo the Elder]] (16th century).\n*Civic Gallery, with works by Matteo da Gualdo and others.\n==Economy==\n[[Image:Piatto ceramica umbra.jpg|thumb|left|180px|&lt;center&gt;Traditional umbrian ceramic plate&lt;/center&gt;]]\nThe city was famous in the Middle Ages for the manufacture of [[ceramic]] ware; in the late 20th century, the ceramic industry was revived, and Gualdo is now an important center for the manufacture of industrial ceramics and bathroom fittings.\n{{-}}\n==Transportation==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nGualdo Tadino has a railway station on the line from [[Ancona]] to [[Foligno]], with some trains continuing through to Rome. The journey time to Ancona is typically one hour and 45 minutes, and to Foligno 40 minutes.\n==''Frazioni''==\nBoschetto, Busche, Caprara, Cerqueto, Corcia, Crocicchio, Gaifana, Grello, Palazzo Mancinelli, Petroia, Piagge, [http://www.pievedicompresseto.it Pieve di Compresseto], Poggio Sant'Ercolano, Rasina, Rigali, Roveto, San Lorenzo, San Pellegrino, Vaccara\n==External links==\n*[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Umbria/Perugia/Gualdo_Tadino/Gualdo_Tadino/home.html Bill Thayer's site]\n*[http://www.protadino.it/20040919/08archeolog04.html possible excavations at Taino]\n&lt;br&gt;\n{{Province of Perugia}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Hilltowns in Umbria]]\n[[Category:Roman sites of Umbria]]"
