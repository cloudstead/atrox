But the greatly superior regimental efficiency of the French, and Catinat's minute attention to details in arraying them, gave the new marshal a victory that was a not unworthy pendant to [[Battle of Neerwinden (1693)|Neerwinden]].\nThe Piedmontese and their allies lost c. 10,000 killed, wounded and prisoners, as against Catinat's 1,800.\nMarsaglia is, if not the first, at any rate, one of the first, instances of a [[bayonet]] charge by a long deployed line of infantry. [[Hussars]] figured here for the first time in western Europe. A regiment of them had been raised in 1692 from deserters from the Austrian service.\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{coord|44.4500|N|7.9667|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2011}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marsaglia 1693, Battle Of}}\n[[Category:1693 in France]]\n[[Category:Battles of the Nine Years' War]]\n[[Category:Battles involving France]]\n[[Category:Battles involving Spain]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1693]]"
