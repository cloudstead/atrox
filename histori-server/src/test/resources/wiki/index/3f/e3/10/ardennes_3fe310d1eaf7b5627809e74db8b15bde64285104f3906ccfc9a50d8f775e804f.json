Geologically, the range is a western extension of the [[Eifel]] and both were raised during the [[Devonian|Givetian stage]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|defining stratotype]] for the geological period is an outcropping in [[Givet]] in the Ardennes.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Devonian (419.2 ± 3.2 to about 358 million years ago&lt;ref&gt;Gerrard, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;) as were several other named ranges of the same greater range.\nPrimarily in [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]], but stretching into [[Germany]] and [[France]] (lending its name to the [[Ardennes (département)|Ardennes]] ''[[Departments of France|department]]'' and the [[Champagne-Ardenne]] ''[[List of regions in France|région]]''), and geologically into the [[Eifel]]&amp;mdash;the eastern extension of the Ardennes Forest into [[Bitburg-Prüm]], [[Germany]], most of the Ardenne proper consists of southeastern [[Wallonia]], the southern and more rural part of the Kingdom of Belgium (away from the coastal plain but encompassing over half of the kingdom's total area). The eastern part of the Ardennes forms the northernmost third of the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]], also called &quot;Oesling&quot; (Luxembourgish: ''Éislek''), and on the southeast the [[Eifel]] region continues into [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (German state).&lt;!-- Do NOT include &quot;Vlaamse Ardennnen&quot; (translated from Dutch &quot;Flemish Ardennes&quot;) which is a totally separate area in the West of Belgium, south of Ghent--&gt;\n&lt;!-- tried to fix this up and retain what I perceive the author tried to say, but am not convinced it belongs in the lead at all, at all. If so, it would be equally valid to add Germany's use of the region as an invasion route around the defenses of Belgium and France in WW-II - so I did.\n--&gt;\nThe trees and rivers of the Ardenne provided the underlying charcoal industry assets that enabled the great industrial period of Wallonia in the 18th and 19th centuries, when it was arguably the [[History of Wallonia#Second Industrial Power of the World|second great industrial region]] of the world, after England. The greater region maintained an industrial eminence into the 20th century after coal replaced charcoal in [[metallurgy]].\nAllied generals in [[World War II]] felt the region was impenetrable to massed vehicular traffic and especially armor, so the area was effectively &quot;all but undefended&quot; during the war, leading to the German Army twice using the region as an invasion route into Northern France and Southern Belgium via [[Luxembourg]] in the [[Battle of France]] and the later [[Battle of the Bulge]].\n==Geography==\nMuch of the Ardennes is covered in dense forests, with the mountains averaging around {{convert|350|–|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height but rising to over {{convert|694|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the boggy moors of the [[Hautes Fagnes]] (Hohes Venn) region of south-eastern Belgium. The region is typified by steep-sided valleys carved by swift-flowing rivers, the most prominent of which is the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]]. Its most populous cities are [[Verviers]] in Belgium and [[Charleville-Mézières]] in France, both exceeding 50,000 inhabitants. The Ardennes is otherwise relatively sparsely populated, with few of the cities exceeding 10,000 inhabitants with a few exceptions like [[Eupen]] or [[Bastogne]].\nThe [[Eifel]] range in Germany adjoins the Ardennes and is part of the same geological formation, although they are conventionally regarded as being two distinct areas.\n=== Highest summits ===\n* [[Signal de Botrange]] {{convert|abbr=on|694|m}}, highest peak in the [[High Fens]], [[Province of Liège]] (Belgium),\n* [[Weißer Stein (Eifel)|Weißer Stein]] {{convert|abbr=on|692|m}}, Mürringen, [[Province of Liège]] (Belgium),\n* [[Baraque Michel]] {{convert|abbr=on|674|m}}, [[Province of Liège]] (Belgium),\n* [[Baraque de Fraiture]] {{convert|abbr=on|652|m}}, highest point of the [[Plateau des Tailles]], [[Province of Luxembourg]] (Belgium),\n* Lieu-dit (=place called) Galata {{convert|abbr=on|589|m}}, highest point on the Plateau de Saint-Hubert, Province of Luxembourg (Belgium),\n* Buergplaz (formerly: [[Buurgplaatz]]), {{convert| abbr=on|559|m}}, highest point in the Oesling section of the Ardennes, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg\n* [[Napoléonsgaard]] {{convert|abbr=on|547|m}}, near Rambrouch-Rammerech, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg\n* [[Croix-Scaille]] {{convert|abbr=on|504|m}}, hosting the [[Tour du Millénaire]], [[Province of Namur]], in Belgium on the border to France.\nN.B. the Belgian Province of Luxembourg in the above list is not to be confused with the country known as the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\n==Geology==\n''L'Ardenne'' (French spelling) is an old mountain formed during the [[Hercynian orogeny]]; in France similar formations are the [[Armorican Massif]], the [[Massif Central]], and the [[Vosges Mountains|Vosges]]. The low interior of such old mountains often contain coal, plus iron, zinc and other metals in the sub-soil. This geologic fact explains the greatest part of the geography of Wallonia and its history. In the North and West of the Ardennes lie the valleys of the [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse]] rivers, forming an arc ([[Sillon industriel]]) going across the most industrial provinces of Wallonia, for example [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]], along the river [[Haine]] (the etymology of Hainaut); the [[Borinage]], the ''Centre'' and [[Charleroi]] along the river [[Sambre]]; [[Liège (province)|Liège]] along the river [[Meuse River|Meuse]].\nThis geological region is important in the history of Wallonia because this old mountain is at the origin of the economy, the history, and the geography of Wallonia. &quot;Wallonia presents a wide range of rocks of various ages. Some geological stages internationally recognized were defined from rock sites located in Wallonia: e.g. [[Frasnian]] ([[Couvin|Frasnes-lez-Couvin]]), [[Famennian]] ([[Famenne]]), [[Tournaisian]] ([[Tournai]]), [[Visean]] ([[Visé]]), [[Dinantian]] ([[Dinant]]) and [[Namurian]] ([[Namur (city)|Namur]])&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20141015222158/http://www.naturalsciences.be/institute/structure/geology/gsb_website/research/geoheritage/geoheritage &quot;Most beautiful rocks of Wallonia&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the Tournaisian, all these rocks are within the Ardennes geological area.\n==Economy==\nThe Ardennes includes the greatest part of the Belgian [[Luxembourg (province)|province of Luxembourg]] (number 4; not to confound with the neighbouring Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), the south of the [[Namur (province)|province of Namur]] (number 5) and the [[Liège (province)|province of Liège]] (number 3) plus a very small part of the province of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] (number 2), as well as the northernmost third of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, called Oesling (Luxembourgish: ''Éislek'') and the main part of the French département called Ardennes.\nBefore the 19th century industrialization, the first furnaces in the four Walloon provinces and in the French Ardennes used charcoal for fuel, made from harvesting the Ardennes forest. This industry was also in the extreme south of the present-day Belgian province of [[Luxembourg (province)|Luxembourg]] (which until 1839 was part of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), in the region called [[Gaume]]. The most important part of the Walloon steel industry, using coal, was built around the coal mines, mainly in the region around the cities of Liège, Charleroi, [[La Louvière]], the [[Borinage]], and further in the [[Walloon Brabant]] (in [[Tubize]]). Wallonia became the second industrial power area of the world (after Great Britain) in proportion to its territory and to its population (see further).\nThe rugged terrain of the Ardennes limits the scope for [[agriculture]]; arable and dairy farming in cleared areas form the mainstay of the agricultural economy. The region is rich in timber and minerals, and Liège and [[Namur (city)|Namur]] are both major industrial centres. The extensive forests have an abundant population of [[wild game]]. The scenic beauty of the region and its wide variety of outdoor activities, including hunting, cycling, walking and canoeing, make it a popular tourist destination.\n==History==\n[[Image:RocherBayardDinant.JPG|thumb|right|Rock Bayard of Dinant, on the right bank of the [[Meuse River]]. In one legend, a magic horse jumped from the top of this rock to the left bank of the river, carrying the ''Quatre Fils Aymon'' fleeing [[Charlemagne]].]]\nThe region took its name from the ancient ''Silva'', a vast forest in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times called ''Arduenna Silva''. The modern Ardennes covers a much smaller area.\nIn ''[[The Song of Roland]]'', [[Charlemagne]] was described as having a nightmare the night before the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]. This nightmare took place in the Ardennes' forest, where his most important battles occurred.\nMany of Wallonia's rivers, villages and other places are named in another song about Charlemagne: the [[Old French]] 12th-century [[chanson de geste]] &quot;''[[Quatre Fils Aymon]]''&quot;. In [[Dinant]] is the rock named ''Bayard''. This rock was named for [[Bayard (legend)|Bayard]], the magic bay horse which, according to the legend, jumped from the top of the rock to the other bank of the Meuse.\nThe strategic position of the Ardennes has made it a battleground for European powers for centuries. The very most of the Ardennes was part of the Duchy (since 1815 Grand Duchy) of Luxembourg, a member state of the Holy Roman Empire, which changed hands numerous times between the powerful dynasties of Europe. In 1793 the whole area was annexed by revolutionary France, together with all other territories west of the Rhine river. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna, which dealt with the political aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, restored the previous geographical situation, with the very most of the Ardennes being again part of the then Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. After the revolution of 1830 which resulted in the creation of the Kingdom of Belgium, the political future of the Ardennes was heavily disputed between Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, as well as the contemporary big powers France, Prussia and Great Britain. As a result, in 1839 the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg ceded the westernmost 63 % of its territory (being also the main part of the Ardennes) to the new Kingdom of Belgium, which renamed the area ''Province of Luxembourg''.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Trausch, Le Luxembourg à l'époque contemporaine, p 15 to 25, publ. Bourg-Bourger, Luxembourg 1981&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn the 20th century, the Ardennes was widely thought unsuitable for large-scale military operations, due to its difficult terrain and narrow lines of communications. But, in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], Germany successfully gambled on making a rapid passage through the Ardennes to attack a relatively lightly defended part of France. The Ardennes was the site of three major battles during the world wars &amp;ndash; the [[Battle of the Ardennes]] in World War I, and the [[Battle of France]] and [[Battle of the Bulge]] in World War II. Many of the towns of the region were badly damaged during the two world wars.\n{{multiple image\n| align     = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    = 1914\n| header_align = center\n| image1    = Bataille des Frontières.svg\n| width1    = 375\n| caption1  = [[Battles of the Frontiers]] (1914) were a series of collisions between the French and the German armies.

The forest's great size could conceal the [[armoured division]]s, and because the French did not suspect the Germans to make such a risky move, they did not consider a breakthrough there. German forces primarily led by [[Erich von Manstein]] carried out the plan, and managed to slip numerous divisions past the [[Maginot Line]] to attack France. This event is frequently considered one of the greatest large-scale armoured movements in history.\nIn May, 1940, the German army crossed the Meuse, despite the resistance of the [[French army]]. Under the command of [[Heinz Guderian#World War II|General Heinz Guderian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frieser|first=Karl|title=The Blitzkrieg Legend|year=2005|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, MD|pages=100–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; the German armoured divisions crossed the river at Dinant and at [[Sedan, France]].\nThe Ardennes area is also well known because of the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. The German Army launched a surprise attack in December, 1944, in an attempt to capture [[Antwerp]] and drive a wedge between the British and American forces in northern France. The German advance was stopped at the river Meuse at Dinant. Local residents say that a German vehicle exploded just before the Bayard rock, possibly after triggering a mine laid by US soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  They said the incident followed the legend of protection by the rock and its horse. Dinant's Rock was perhaps the most advanced position of the German army during this battle.\n{{clear}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    = 1940\n| header_align = center\n| image1    = 10May-16May1940-Fall Gelb.svg\n| width1    = 375\n| caption1  = [[Battle of France]] (1940) The Germans execute [[Erich Von Manstein]]'s plan for Operation ''Fall Gelb''.

The latter region is just at the east of the red shading which marks the extent of the German advance.

This cut off the Allied troops of the North (Some French Divisions, the [[Belgian Army]] and the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]]). With this, they won the first stage of the [[Battle of France]].\n}}\n{{clear}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    = 1944\n| header_align = center\n| image1    = Battle of the Bulge progress.svg\n| width1    = 475\n| caption1  = [[Battle of the Bulge]].
