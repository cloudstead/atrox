Photo taken in July 2011 by Jeffrey S. Williams]]\nThe '''Battle of Chusto-Talasah''' (also known as '''Bird Creek''', '''Caving Banks''', and '''High Shoal''') was fought December 9, 1861, in what is now [[Tulsa County, Oklahoma]] (then [[Unassigned Lands|Indian Territory]]) during the [[American Civil War]]. It was the second of three battles in the [[Trail of Blood on Ice]] campaign for the control of [[Indian Territory]] during the [[American Civil War]].\nA series of battles were fought in December in bad weather between the Confederate [[Cherokee Indians|Cherokee]] and [[Choctaw Indians]] and the Union [[Creek (people)|Creek]] and [[Seminole Indians]] (led by the Muscogee Creek chief [[Opothleyahola]]) who supported the Federal government. Following Opothleyahola and his [[Union Army|Union]] force’s defeat at [[Battle of Round Mountain|Round Mountain]], he retreated northeastward in search of safety. On December 9, 1861, the force was at ''Chusto-Talasah'' (Caving Banks) on the Horseshoe Bend of [[Bird Creek]] when [[Colonel|Col.]] [[Douglas H. Cooper]]’s 1,300 Confederates attacked about 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Chief Opothleyahola knew Cooper was coming and had placed his troops in a strong position in heavy timber at Horseshoe Bend.\nFor almost four hours, Cooper attacked and attempted to outflank the Federals, finally driving them across Bird Creek just before dark. Cooper camped there overnight but did not pursue the Federals because he was short of ammunition.  The Confederates claimed victory. Chief Opothleyahola and his band moved off in search of security elsewhere. Their loss was estimated by Cooper as 500 (some accounts suggest 412). Confederate casualties were 15 killed and 37 wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tindle2000&quot;/&gt;\nAlthough the Confederates had gained a minor tactical victory, they would win a resounding one later in the month at [[Battle of Chustenahlah|Chustenahlah]].\nThe Chusto-Talasah battle site is on privately owned land near 86th Street North and Delaware Avenue, 5 miles northwest of modern [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;C-T_Battle&quot;&gt;THE WAR BETWEEN THE STATES IN INDIAN TERRITORY. &quot;Battle of Chusto-Talasah December 9, 1861.&quot; Accessed August 23, 2012.
