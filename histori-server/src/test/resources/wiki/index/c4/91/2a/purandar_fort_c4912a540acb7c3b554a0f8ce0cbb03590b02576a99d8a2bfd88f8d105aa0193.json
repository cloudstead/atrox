Purandhar fort stands 4,472&amp;nbsp;ft. above the sea (1,387 m) in the [[Western Ghats]], 50 km southeast of [[Pune]] ahead of Saswad village. There are twin forts - Purandar and Vajragad (or Rudramal). The latter is the smaller of the two and is on the eastern side of the main fort. The village [[Purandar]] takes its name from this fort. Purandar fort is also known for birthplace of [[Sambhaji|Sambhaji Raje Bhosale]] (second Chhatrapti and son of [[Shivaji|Chhatrapati Shivajiraje Bhosale]])&lt;ref name = express&gt;[http://www.maharashtratourism.gov.in/MTDC/HTML/MaharashtraTourism/Default.aspx?strpage=../MaharashtraTourism/TouristDelight/Forts/PurandarFort.html  Maharashtra state tourism site]&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:Purandar Fort entrance 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Purandar fort entrance]]\n== History ==\n[[File:Murarbaji.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Murarbaji Deshpande at Purandar Fort]]\nThe earliest known mention of Purandar is in the [[Yadava Dynasty|Yadava]] era (11th century). The 1000yr old Narayaneshwar temple of [[Hemadpanthi]] architecture built by the [[Yadava Dynasty|Yadavas]] still exists in [[Narayanpur, Pune|Narayanpur]], the base village of Purandar. After the defeat of the [[Yadava Dynasty|Yadavas]] by Persian invaders, the territory fell in to the hands of these invaders who further fortified Purandar in 1350. During the early rule of the [[Ahmednagar_State#Bijapur_sultanate|Bijapur]] and [[Ahmednagar_State#Ahmadnagar_sultanate|Ahmednagar]] kings, Purandar was among the forts directly under Government, and never entrusted to [[Jagirdar]]s (estate-holders).&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;\n{{ Citation\n| last=Hunter\n| first=William\n| title=The Imperial Gazetteer of India\n| publisher=Trubner and Co.\n| place=Londan\n| year=1886\n| url = http://www.archive.org/stream/imperialgazettee11hunt/imperialgazettee11hunt_djvu.txt\n| accessdate = 2009-01-18\n}}&lt;/ref&gt;\nSometime under the Bedar kings (1347-1490) the fort was besieged several times. To prevent Purandar fort from falling, a man and a woman were buried alive under one of the fort bastions to appease its patron deity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Solapur/appendix_c.html#1  Sholapur District Gazetteer]&lt;/ref&gt; The king of [[Berar Sultanate|Berar]] then ordered his minister a Esaji Naik Chive to bury a first born son and his wife into the foundation of the bastion. This was promptly done and after a further offering of gold and bricks. When the bastion was finished Esaji Naik was given possession of the fort and the father of the sacrificed boy was rewarded with two villages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toy, 1965&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Toy|first=Sidney|title=The Fortified Cities of India|year=1965|publisher=Heinemann Educational Books Ltd.,|location=London|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:Purandar Fort church.jpg|thumb|Abandoned church, Purandar fort]]\nIn 1596, when [[Bahudar Shah]] of [[Ahmednagar sultanate]] granted [[Maloji Bhosale]](grandfather of [[Shivaji Bhosale]]) Pune and Supa, the fort of Purandar was included as well. In 1646, a 19-year-old Shivaji in one of the first victories of his legendary career, established control in the fort.  In 1665, it was besieged by the forces of [[Aurangzeb]], under the command of [[Jai Singh II|Mirza Raje JaiSingh]], a [[Rajput]] general, assisted by DilerKhan, an [[Afghan]]. The defense of Purandar by [[Murarbaji Deshpande]] of Mhar, the ''killedar'' (keeper of the fort) was obstinate and he lost his life in the struggle to retain the fort. Raja [[Shivaji]] daunted at the prospect of the fall of his grandfathers fort, signed a treaty (the first [[Treaty of Purandar (1665)|Treaty of Purandar]]) with [[Aurangzeb]]. Purandar fort along with [[Vajragad]], [[Sinhgad]] and 22 other forts came under the [[Aurangzeb]]'s control and [[Shivaji]] Raje became his ''jahagirdar'' (glorified tenant). This truce did not last long as [[Shivaji]] revolted against [[Aurangzeb]] and recaptured Purandar only five years later in 1670. Thereafter, [[Shivaji]] spent prolonged periods of time here. [[Sambhaji|Sambhaji Raje Bhosale]], [[Shivaji]] Maharaj's eldest son and successor was born at Purandar fort.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;&lt;ref name=gazette/&gt;\nUnder the [[Peshwa]]s, Purandar was a stronghold to which they retreated whenever [[Pune]], their capital, was under attack. Likely because the fort commands a pass through the [[Sahyadri]] mountain range. In 1776, a treaty was signed between the [[British Raj]] and the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha States]] (the second [[Treaty of Purandar (1665)|Treaty of Purandar]]). Its conditions were never fulfilled, being overruled by the subsequent [[Treaty of Salbai]] in 1782 between the [[British Raj|Bombay Government]] and [[Raghunathrao]], at the close of the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]].&lt;ref name=gazette/&gt;\nIn 1818, Purandar was invested by a [[United Kingdom|British]] force under General Pritzler. On 14 March, a British garrison marched into Vajragad the smaller fort. As Vajragad commanded Purandar, the commandant had to accept terms and the British flag was hoisted at Purandar on 16 March 1818.\nIt is also said that Purandar is the broken part of the Dronagiri Parvat which Hanuman was carrying in Ramayana.&lt;ref name=gazette/&gt;\n[[File:Purandareshwar Temple.jpg|thumb|Temple of the Purandeshwar deity from which Purandar takes its name]]\nDuring [[British Raj]] rule it was used as a prison. During [[World War II]] it was an internment camp for enemy-alien (i.e. [[Germany|German]]) families. [[Jew]]s from Germany were interned here along with [[Aryan]]s. A German prisoner Dr. H. Goetz was kept here during [[World War II]]. He studied the fort during his stay there and later published a book on it. It major use however was as a [[sanatorium]] for [[British Raj|British]] soldiers.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;\n== Structures within the fort ==\n[[File:Veer_Murarbaji_Deshpande_mausoleum.JPG|thumb]]\nThe fort has two distinct levels.  The lower part of purandar is called the ''machi''. North of the machi is a flat area where the cantonment and hospital was housed. There are many temples dedicated to Purandareshwar (the fort's patron god, from which it also takes its name) and Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa here. There is a statue of [[Murarbaji Deshpande]], the fort-commander (''killedar'') who gave his life to protect the fort from the [[Mughals]].The northern part of the ''machi'' has a low fall with several bastions and an imposing gate with two towers.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazette&quot; /&gt;\nFrom the lower level called ''machi'' a staircase leads to the upper level called ''Ballekilla''.  The first structure of the ''Ballekilla'' that comes into view is the Dilli Darwaza (Delhi Gate).  This area also houses an ancient Kedareshwar ([[Shiva]]) temple. The higher level called ''Ballekilla'' is surrounded by steep drop on three sides.\nShivaji and the Maratha Art of War a book by Murlidhar Balkrishna Deopujari, published by Vidarbha Samshodhan Mandal, in 1973 - India - 276 pages.
