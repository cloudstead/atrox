Po-chia Hsia, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein, and Bonnie Smith, ''The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures: A Concise History: Volume I: To 1740'', Second Edition (New York: Bedford/St. Martin's 2007), 391.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Christian]] forces of King [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] were joined by the armies of his rivals, [[Sancho VII of Navarre]], [[Peter II of Aragon]] and [[Afonso II of Portugal]] in battle&lt;ref&gt;Guggenberger, Anthony, ''A General History of the Christian Era: The Papacy and the Empire'', Vol.1, (B. Herder, 1913), 372.&lt;/ref&gt; against the [[Berber People|Berber]] [[Almohad]] [[Muslim]] rulers of the southern half of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The [[Muhammad an-Nasir|Caliph al-Nasir]] (''[[Amir al-Muminin|Miramamolín]]'' in the Spanish chronicles) led the [[Almohad]] army, made up of people from the whole Almohad empire. Most of the men in the Almohad army came from the African side of the empire.\n==Background==\nIn 1195, Alfonso VIII of Castile was defeated by the Almohads in the so-called [[Battle of Alarcos|Disaster of Alarcos]].  After this victory the Almohads took several important cities: [[Trujillo, Spain|Trujillo]], [[Plasencia]], [[Talavera de la Reina|Talavera]], [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], and [[Uclés]]. Then, in 1211, [[Muhammad an-Nasir|Muhammad al-Nasir]] crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] with a powerful army, invaded Christian territory, and captured [[Salvatierra Castle]], the stronghold of the knights of the [[Order of Calatrava]]. The threat to the Iberian Christian kingdoms was so great that [[Pope Innocent III]] called European knights to a [[crusade]].\n==Previous movements==\nThere were some disagreements among the members of the Christian coalition: French and other European knights did not agree with  Alfonso's merciful treatment of Jews and Muslims that were previously defeated in the conquest of [[Malagón]] and [[Calatrava la Vieja]]. Previously, they had caused problems in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], (where the different armies of the Crusade gathered),  with assaults and murders in the [[Jewish Quarter (diaspora)|Jewish Quarter]]. More than 30,000 men deserted and returned to their homes across the [[Pyrenees]].\n==Battle==\nAlfonso crossed the mountain range that defended the Almohad camp, sneaking through the [[Despeñaperros Pass]], being led by [[Martin Alhaja]], a local shepherd that knew the area. The Christian coalition caught the Moorish army at camp by surprise, and Alhaja was granted the hereditary title [[Cabeza de Vaca]] for his assistance to Alfonso VIII.\n[[File:NavasDeTolosaMonument.jpg|left|thumbnail|Monument at Navas De Tolosa]]\nAccording to legend, the Caliph had his tent surrounded with a bodyguard of slave-warriors who were chained together as a defense. The Navarrese force led by their king Sancho VII broke through this bodyguard. The Caliph escaped, but the Moors were routed, leaving some 100,000 casualties on the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;According to the king of Castile, &quot;On their side 100,000 armed men fell in battle...&quot; See Lynn Hunt, R. Po-chia Hsia, Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein, and Bonnie Smith, ''The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures: A Concise History: Volume I: To 1740'', Second Edition (New York: Bedford/St. Martin's 2007), 391.&lt;/ref&gt;  The victorious Christians seized several prizes of war: Miramamolín's tent and standard were delivered to [[Pope Innocent III]].&lt;ref&gt;''Riga and Rome: Henry of Livonia and the Papal Curia'', Iben Fonnesberg-Schmidt, '''Crusading and Chronicle Writing on the Medieval Baltic Frontier''', ed. Marek Tamm, Linda Kaljundi, Carsten Selch Jensen, (Ashgate Publishing, 2011), 224.&lt;/ref&gt;\nChristian losses were far fewer, only about 2,000 men (though not as few as legend had it). The losses were particularly heavy among the Orders. Those killed included Pedro Gómez de Acevedo (bannerman of the ''[[Order of Calatrava]]''), Alfonso Fernández de Valladares (''comendator'' of the ''[[Order of Santiago]]''), Pedro Arias (master of the ''Order of Santiago'', died of wounds on 3 August) and Gomes Ramires (Portuguese master of the ''[[Knights Templar]]''). Ruy Díaz (master of the ''Order of Calatrava'') was so grievously wounded that he had to resign his command.\nThe Caliph Muhammad al-Nasir himself died in [[Marrakech]] shortly after the battle, where he had fled after the defeat.\n==Aftermath==\nThe crushing defeat of the Almohads significantly hastened their decline both in the Iberian Peninsula and in the [[Maghreb]] a decade later. This would give further momentum to the [[Christian Reconquest]] begun by the kingdoms of northern Iberia centuries before, resulting in a sharp reduction in the already declining power of the [[Moors]] in the Iberian Peninsula. Shortly after the battle, the Castilians took [[Baeza]] and then [[Úbeda]], major fortified cities near the battlefield, and gateways to invade [[Andalusia]]. Thereafter, Alfonso VIII's grandson [[Ferdinand III of Castile]] took [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordova]] in 1236, [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]] [[Siege of Jaén (1245-46)|in 1246]], and [[Seville]] in 1248; then he took [[Arcos de la Frontera|Arcos]], [[Medina-Sidonia]], [[Jerez]] and [[Cadiz]]. After this chain of victories, only Ferdinand's death prevented the Castilians from crossing the Gibraltar Strait to take the war to the heartland of the Almohad empire.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Ferdinand III died in Seville on 30 May 1252, when a plague spread over the southern part of the Iberian peninsula while he was preparing his army and fleet to cross the Straits of Gibraltar. On the Mediterranean coast, [[James I of Aragon]], proceeded to conquer the [[Balearic Islands]] (from 1228 over the following four years) and [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] (the city capitulated on 28 September 1238).\nBy 1252 the Almohad empire was almost over, at the mercy of another emerging African power. In 1269 a new association of African tribes, the [[Marinid]], has taken control of the Maghreb, and most of the former Almohad empire was under their rule. Later, the Marinids tried to recover the former Almohad territories in the Iberian peninsula, but they were definitively defeated by [[Alfonso XI of Castile|Alfonso XI]], and King [[Afonso IV of Portugal|Afonso IV]] of Portugal in the [[Battle of Río Salado]], the last major military encounter between large Christian and Muslim armies in the Iberian peninsula.\n===Moorish Granada===\nIn 1292 Sancho IV took [[Tarifa]] (the city resisted a siege in 1294), key to the control of the Strait of Gibraltar. [[Granada]], [[Almería]] and [[Málaga]] were the only major Muslim cities of the time remaining in the Iberian peninsula. These three cities were the core of the [[Nasrid dynasty]] and its [[Emirate of Granada]], which was a [[vassal state]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], until the kingdom was finally taken by the [[Catholic Monarchs]] in 1492.\n===In fiction ===\n[[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s 1972 [[alternate history]]/[[science fiction]] novel &quot;[[Tunnel Through the Deeps]]&quot; depicts a history where the Moors won at Las Navas de Tolosa and retained part of Spain into the 20th century.\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n==References==\n* Alvira Cabrer, Martín, ''Las Navas de Tolosa, 1212: idea, liturgia y memoria de la batalla'', Sílex Ediciones, Madrid 2012 (Spanish).\n* García Fitz, Francisco, ''Las Navas de Tolosa'', Ariel, Barcelona 2005 (Spanish).\n* García Fitz, Francisco, ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17546559.2012.677160#.UsvqHPvEeuI Was Las Navas a decisive battle?]'', in: ''Journal of Medieval Iberian Studies'' (JMIS), vol. 4, no. 1, 5–9.\n* Nafziger, George F. and Mark W.
