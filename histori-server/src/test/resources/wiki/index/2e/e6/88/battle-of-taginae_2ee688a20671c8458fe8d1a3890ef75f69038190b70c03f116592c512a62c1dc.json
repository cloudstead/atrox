During 550-51 a large expeditionary force totaling 20,000 or possibly 25,000 men was gradually assembled at [[Salona]] on the [[Adriatic]], comprising regular Byzantine units and a large contingent of foreign allies, notably [[Lombards]], [[Heruls]] and [[Bulgars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norwich251&quot;&gt;J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Early Centuries'', p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial [[chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] (''[[cubicularius]]'') Narses was appointed to command in mid 551. The following spring Narses led this Byzantine army around the coast of the Adriatic as far as [[Ancona]], and then turned inland aiming to march down the [[Via Flaminia]] to [[Rome]].\n==Deployment==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=June 2013}}\nNear the village of Taginae (traditionally located somewhere to the north of modern [[Gualdo Tadino]]), the Byzantines encountered the Ostrogothic army commanded by King [[Totila]], who had been advancing to intercept him.  Finding himself considerably outnumbered, Totila ostensibly entered into negotiations while planning a surprise attack, but Narses was not fooled by this stratagem.\nAlthough he enjoyed superiority in numbers, Narses deployed his army in a strong defensive position. In the centre he massed the large body of Germanic mercenaries dismounted in a dense formation. and placed the Byzantine troops to either side. On each wing he stationed 4,000 foot-archers.\n==Battle==\nTotila initially attempted to outflank his opponent by seizing a small hill on the Byzantine left which dominated the only route to the rear of the Byzantine line, but some of the Byzantine infantry deployed in a compact well-shielded formation managed to beat off successive attacks of the Ostrogothic cavalry.\nHaving failed to turn Narses' position, and expecting 2,000 reinforcements from [[Teia]], Totila used various expedients to delay the battle, including disingenuous offers of negotiation and duels enacted between the battle-lines. In one such occasion, Totila sent a Byzantine deserter named Coccas out to challenge any Byzantine to single combat. Coccas was large and immensely strong. He had a reputation among the Goths as a ruthless and powerful fighter. An Armenian named Anzalas, one of Narses' bodyguards, answered the challenge. Coccas charged at Anzalas, but at the last moment, Anzalas swerved his horse and stabbed the Gothic champion in the side. It was not the most auspicious omen for the Ostrogoths.\nHowever, the Ostrogothic King had another delaying tactic. Both armies watched as Totila, dressed in shining purple and gold armor, and riding a huge stallion, cantered out towards the space between the two large armies. His horse went circles, reared, pirouetted, and ran backwards as Totila tossed his lance into the air and caught it. At last, he rode back to his own army and changed into battle armor. Teia had arrived.\nHis reinforcements having arrived, Totila broke formation and retired for lunch.  Narses, wary of a possible ruse, permitted his troops to refresh themselves without leaving their positions. Totila, apparently hoping to take his enemy by surprise, launched a sudden large-scale mounted assault upon the Byzantine center. Ancient and modern authors have accused him of folly, but Totila probably sought to close with the enemy as fast as possible in order to avoid the effects of the formidable Byzantine archers. The Byzantines were prepared for such a move, however, and the archers massed on the flanks to incline their front towards the center so that his battle-line became crescent-shaped. Caught in the [[enfilading]] fire from both sides, the Ostrogothic cavalry sustained high casualties and their attack faltered. The course and duration of the subsequent battle are uncertain, but towards early evening Narses ordered a general advance, and the Ostrogoths broke and fled. Although accounts vary, it was probably during the subsequent rout that Totila was killed.\n==Aftermath==\nNarses proceeded to Rome which fell with limited resistance. The Ostrogoths regrouped under Totila's successor Teia, but suffered a final defeat at the [[Battle of Mons Lactarius]] (near Mount [[Vesuvius]]) and thereafter played no significant part in the history of Italy.\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n== Sources ==\n*{{cite journal|first= H.N.|last= Roisl|title=Totila und die Schlacht bei den Busta Gallorum, Ende Juni/Anfang Juli 552|journal=Jahrbuch der ��sterreichischen Byzantinistik|issue= 30|year=1981|pages=25���50}}\n*{{cite book|first= Roy|last= Boss|title=Justinian's Wars: Belisarius, Narses and the Reconquest of the West|location=Stockport|year= 1993}}\n*{{cite book | last=Haldon| first=John | title=The Byzantine Wars | publisher=The History Press | year=2008 | isbn= }}\n* {{cite journal|first=Philip|last= Rance|title=Narses and the Battle of Taginae (Busta Gallorum) 552: Procopius and sixth century warfare|journal=Historia|issue= 54|year=2005|pages=424���472}}\n*{{cite book |author=Weir, William |title=50 Battles That Changed the World: The Conflicts That Most Influenced the Course of History |publisher=Barnes and Noble Books |location=Savage, Md |year= |isbn=0-7607-6609-6}}\n*{{cite book | last=Treadgold| first=Warren | title=A History of the Byzantine State and Society | publisher=The Stanford Press | year=1997}}\n*{{cite book | last=Norwich| first=John J. | title=Byzantium: The Early Centuries | publisher=Alfred A.
