The [[First English Civil War|first]] (1642���46) and [[Second English Civil War|second]] (1648���49) wars pitted the supporters of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] against the supporters of the [[Long Parliament]], while the [[Third English Civil War|third]] (1649���51) saw fighting between supporters of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and supporters of the [[Rump Parliament]]. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651.\nThe overall outcome of the war was threefold: the trial and [[execution of Charles I]]; the exile of his son, Charles II; and the replacement of [[English monarchy]] with, at first, the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649���53) and then [[the Protectorate]] (1653���59) under [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s personal rule. The monopoly of the [[Church of England]] on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament's consent, although the idea of parliament as the ruling power of England was legally established as part of the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Editors Of The Encyclopedia Britannica|title=Glorious Revolution |url=http://www.britannica.com/event/Glorious-Revolution|website=Encyclopedia Britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n==Terminology==\nThe term &quot;English Civil War&quot; appears most often in the singular form, although historians often divide the conflict into two or three separate wars. Nor were these wars restricted to [[England]]. [[Wales]] was then a part of the Kingdom of England, and was affected accordingly; from the outset, moreover, the conflicts involved wars with and civil wars within both [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]] (see [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] for an overview).\nUnlike other [[List of English civil wars|civil wars in England]], which focused on who should rule, this war was more concerned with the manner in which the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] were governed. The [[1911 Encyclop��dia Britannica]] called the series of conflicts the &quot;Great Rebellion&quot;, while some historians{{spaced ndash}}especially [[Marxist]]s such as [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] (1912���2003){{spaced ndash}}have long favoured the term &quot;[[English Revolution]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1972|loc=for example}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\n==Strategy and tactics==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}\nMany of the officers and veteran soldiers of the English Civil war studied and implemented war strategies that had been learned and perfected in other wars across Europe, namely by the Spanish and the Dutch during the Dutch war for independence which began in 1568.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Baker|title=A Battlefield Atlas of the English Civil War|url=|accessdate=|date=1986|location=Shepperton, UK|publisher=Routledge|isbn=|pages={{page needed|date=April 2015}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe main battle tactic came to be known as [[pike and shot]] infantry, in which both sides would line up facing each other with infantry brigades of musketeers in the centre, carrying matchlock muskets;&lt;ref name=&quot;Simkin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=John Simkin |title=The English Civil War ��� Tactics |orig-year=originally September 1997 |date= August 2014 |access-date=20 April 2015 |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/STUcivilwarMT.htm |publisher=Spartacus Educational}}{{better source|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; these muskets were inaccurate,&lt;ref name=&quot;Simkin&quot; /&gt; but could be lethal from up to 300 yards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simkin&quot; /&gt; The brigades would arrange themselves in lines of musketeers, three deep, where the first row would kneel, the second would crouch, and the third would stand, allowing all three to fire a volley simultaneously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simkin&quot; /&gt; At times there would be two groups of three lines allowing one group to reload while the other group arranged themselves and fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred H.

Elizabeth's death had resulted in the accession of her [[Cousin chart|first cousin twice-removed]], [[James VI and I|King James VI of Scotland]], to the English throne as James I of England, creating the first [[Union of the Crowns|personal union of the Scottish and English kingdoms]].{{efn|Although the early 17th century Stuart monarchs styled themselves King of Great Britain, France and Ireland,  with the exception of the constitutional arrangements during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] (see the [[Tender of Union]]), full union of the Scottish and English realms into a new realm of Great Britain did not occur until the passing of the [[Act of Union 1707]].}} As King of Scots, James had become accustomed to Scotland's weak parliamentary tradition since assuming control of the Scottish government in 1583, so that upon assuming power south of the border, the new King of England was genuinely affronted by the constraints the English Parliament attempted to place on him in exchange for money. In spite of this, James' personal extravagance meant he was perennially short of money and had to resort to extra-Parliamentary sources of income.\nJames' personal extravagance was tempered by his peaceful disposition, so that by the succession of his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] to the English and Scottish thrones in 1625 the two kingdoms had both experienced relative peace, both internally and in their relations with each other, for as long as anyone could remember. Charles hoped to unite the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland into a new single kingdom, fulfilling the dream of his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Croft|2003|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many English Parliamentarians had suspicions regarding such a move because they feared that setting up a new kingdom might destroy the old English traditions which had bound the English monarchy. As Charles shared his father's position on the power of the crown (James had described kings as &quot;little gods on Earth&quot;, chosen by God to rule in accordance with the doctrine of the &quot;[[Divine Right of Kings]]&quot;), the suspicions of the Parliamentarians had some justification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McClelland|1996|p=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:King Charles I after original by van Dyck.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Charles I, painted by Van Dyck]]\n===Parliament in the English constitutional framework===\nAt the time, the [[Parliament of England]] did not have a large permanent role in the English system of government.  Instead, Parliament functioned as a temporary advisory committee and was summoned only if and when the monarch saw fit to summon it. Once summoned, a parliament's continued existence was at the king's pleasure, since it was subject to dissolution by him at any time.\nYet in spite of this limited role, Parliament had, over the preceding centuries, acquired ''de facto'' powers of enough significance that monarchs could not simply ignore them indefinitely. Without question, for a monarch, Parliament's most indispensable power was its ability to raise tax revenues far in excess of all other sources of revenue at the Crown's disposal. By the seventeenth century, Parliament's tax-raising powers had come to be derived from the fact that the [[gentry]] was the only stratum of society with the ability and authority to actually collect and remit the most meaningful forms of taxation then available at the local level. This meant that if the king wanted to ensure a smooth collection of revenue, he needed the co-operation of the gentry. For all of the Crown's legal authority, by any modern standard, its resources were limited to the extent that, if and when the gentry refused to collect the king's taxes on a national scale, the Crown lacked any practical means with which to compel them.\nTherefore, in order to secure their co-operation, monarchs permitted the gentry (and only the gentry) to elect representatives to sit in the House of Commons. When assembled along with the House of Lords, these elected representatives formed a Parliament. Parliaments therefore, allowed representatives of the gentry to meet, primarily (at least in the opinion of the monarch) so that they could give their sanction to whatever taxes the monarch expected their electorate to collect. In the process, the representatives could also confer and send policy proposals to the king in the form of bills. However, Parliament lacked any legal means of forcing its will upon the monarch; its only leverage with the king was the threat of its withholding the financial means required to execute his plans.{{sfn|Johnston|1901|pp=83���86}}\n===Parliamentary concerns and the Petition of Right===\n[[File:Sir Peter Lely 001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], painted by [[Peter Lely]], 1660]]\nMany concerns were raised over Charles's marriage to a Roman Catholic, French princess [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], in 1625.  The Parliament refused to assign him the traditional right to collect customs duties for his entire reign, deciding instead to grant it only on a provisional basis and negotiate with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gregg|1984|pp=129���30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\nCharles, meanwhile, decided to send an expeditionary force to relieve the French [[Huguenots]] whom French royal troops held [[Siege of La Rochelle|besieged in La Rochelle]]. Military support for Protestants on the Continent was, in itself, popular both in Parliament and with the Protestant majority in general,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and it had the potential to alleviate concerns brought about by the King's marriage to a Catholic. However, Charles's insistence on having his unpopular royal favourite [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham]], assume command of the English force undermined that support. Unfortunately for Charles and Buckingham, the relief expedition proved a fiasco (1627),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gregg|1984|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Parliament, already hostile to Buckingham for his monopoly on [[Patronage|royal patronage]], opened [[impeachment]] proceedings against him.&lt;ref name=Gregg-175&gt;{{Harvnb|Gregg|1984|p=175}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles responded by dissolving Parliament. This move, while saving Buckingham, reinforced the impression that Charles wanted to avoid Parliamentary scrutiny of his ministers.&lt;ref name=Gregg-175/&gt;\nHaving dissolved Parliament and unable to raise money without it, the king assembled a new one in 1628. (The elected members included [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[Edward Coke]].) The new Parliament drew up the [[Petition of Right]], and Charles accepted it as a concession in order to obtain his subsidy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Purkiss 2007 93&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst other things, the Petition referred to the [[Magna Carta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Petition of Right]] at III, VII.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did not grant him the right of [[tonnage and poundage]], which Charles had been collecting without Parliamentary authorisation since 1625.&lt;ref name=sommerville/&gt; Several of the more active members of the opposition were imprisoned, which caused some outrage;&lt;ref name=sommerville&gt;Sommerville, Johann P. 1992.

Who's who in British History: A-H. V. 1. P.417&lt;/ref&gt;\n===Personal rule===\nCharles I avoided calling a Parliament for the next decade, a period known as the &quot;[[personal rule of Charles I]]&quot;, or the &quot;Eleven Years' Tyranny&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosner|Theibault|2000|p=103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Charles's lack of money determined policies. First and foremost, to avoid Parliament, the King needed to avoid war. Charles made peace with France and Spain, effectively ending England's involvement in the [[Thirty Years' War]].  However, that in itself was far from enough to balance the Crown's finances.\nUnable to raise revenue without Parliament, and unwilling to convene it, Charles resorted to other means. One method was reviving certain conventions, often long-outdated. For example, a failure to attend and to receive [[knighthood]] at Charles's coronation was a finable offence with the fine paid to the Crown. The King also tried to raise revenue through the [[ship money]] tax, by exploiting a naval war-scare in 1635, demanding that the inland English counties pay the tax for the [[Royal Navy]]. Established law supported this policy, but authorities had ignored it for centuries, and many regarded it as yet another extra-Parliamentary (and therefore illegal) tax.&lt;ref name=Pipes-143&gt;{{Harvnb|Pipes|1999|p=143}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some prominent men refused to pay ship money, arguing that the tax was illegal, but they lost in court, and the fines imposed on them for refusing to pay ship money (and for standing against the tax's legality) aroused widespread indignation.&lt;ref name=Pipes-143/&gt;\nDuring the &quot;Personal Rule,&quot; Charles aroused most antagonism through his religious measures: he believed in [[High church|High Anglicanism]], a sacramental version of the [[Church of England]], theologically based upon [[Arminianism in the Church of England|Arminianism]], a creed shared with his main political advisor, Archbishop [[William Laud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carlton|1987|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1633, Charles appointed Laud as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and started making the Church more ceremonial, replacing the wooden [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] tables with stone altars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carlton|1987|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Puritans accused Laud of reintroducing Catholicism; when they complained, he had them arrested. In 1637 [[John Bastwick]], [[Henry Burton (Puritan)|Henry Burton]], and [[William Prynne]] had their ears cut off for writing pamphlets attacking Laud's views���a rare penalty for [[Gentleman|gentlemen]], and one that aroused anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=201}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Church authorities revived the statutes passed in the time of [[Elizabeth I]] about church attendance, and fined Puritans for not attending Anglican church services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carlton|1987|p=173}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\n===Rebellion in Scotland===\n{{Main|Bishops' War}}\nThe end of Charles's independent governance came when he attempted to apply the same religious policies in Scotland. The [[Church of Scotland]], reluctantly [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] in structure, had independent traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles, however, wanted one uniform Church throughout Britain&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=83}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced a new, High Anglican version of the English [[Book of Common Prayer]] to Scotland in the middle of 1637. This was violently resisted; a riot broke out in Edinburgh,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which may have been started in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], according to legend, by [[Jenny Geddes]].  In February 1638, the Scots formulated their objections to royal policy in the [[National Covenant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This document took the form of a &quot;loyal protest,&quot; rejecting all innovations not first having been tested by free parliaments and General Assemblies of the Church.\nIn the spring of 1639, King Charles I accompanied his forces to the Scottish border to end the rebellion known as the [[Bishops' War]].&lt;ref name=Purkiss-96&gt;{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But, after an inconclusive military campaign, he accepted the offered Scottish truce: the [[Pacification of Berwick]]. The truce proved temporary, and a second war followed in the middle of 1640. This time, a Scots army defeated Charles's forces in the north, then captured [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles eventually agreed not to interfere with Scotland's religion and paid the Scots' war-expenses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n===Recall of the English Parliament===\nCharles needed to suppress the rebellion in Scotland. He had insufficient funds, however, and needed to seek money from a newly elected [[Short Parliament|English Parliament]] in 1640.&lt;ref name=Coward-180&gt;{{Harvnb|Coward|2003|p=180}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority faction in the new Parliament, led by [[John Pym]], took this appeal for money as an opportunity to discuss grievances against the Crown and opposed the idea of an English invasion of Scotland. Charles took exception to this ''[[lese majesty|l��se-majest��]]'' (offence against the ruler) and dissolved the Parliament after only a few weeks; hence the name &quot;the [[Short Parliament]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Coward-180/&gt;\nWithout Parliament's support, Charles attacked Scotland again, breaking the truce at Berwick, and suffered a comprehensive defeat. The Scots went on to invade England, occupying [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]].&lt;ref name=Coward-180/&gt; Meanwhile, another of Charles' chief advisors, [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth, 1st Viscount Wentworth]], had risen to the role of Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1632&lt;ref name=Purkiss-89&gt;{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and brought in much-needed revenue for Charles by persuading the Irish Catholic gentry to pay new taxes in return for promised religious concessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coward|2003|p=172}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn 1639, Charles had recalled Wentworth to England and in 1640 made him Earl of Strafford, attempting to have him achieve similar results in Scotland.&lt;ref name=Purkiss-89/&gt; This time he proved less successful and the English forces fled the field in their second encounter with the Scots in 1640.&lt;ref name=Purkiss-89/&gt; Almost the entirety of Northern England was occupied and Charles was forced to pay ��850 per day to keep the Scots from advancing. If he did not, they would &quot;take&quot; the money by pillaging and burning the cities and towns of Northern England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sharp|2000|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\nAll this put Charles in a desperate financial position. As King of Scots, he had to find money to pay the Scottish army in England; as King of England, he had to find money to pay and equip an English army to defend England. His means of raising English revenue without an English Parliament fell critically short of achieving this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Purkiss 2007 93&quot;/&gt; Against this backdrop, and according to advice from the [[Magnum Concilium]] (the [[House of Lords]], but without the [[House of Commons of England|Commons]], so not a Parliament), Charles finally bowed to pressure and summoned another English Parliament in November 1640.&lt;ref name=Purkiss-96/&gt;\n===The Long Parliament===\n{{Main|Long Parliament}}\n[[File:LongParliament.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Session of the Long Parliament]]\nThe new Parliament proved even more hostile to Charles than its predecessor. It immediately began to discuss grievances against Charles and his government and with Pym and [[John Hampden|Hampden]] (of [[ship money]] fame) in the lead, took the opportunity presented by the King's troubles to force various reforming measures���including many with strong 'anti-Papist' themes���upon him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|pp=104,5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The legislators passed a law which stated that a new Parliament should convene at least once every three years���without the King's summons, if necessary. Other laws passed by the Parliament made it illegal for the king to impose taxes without Parliamentary consent and later gave Parliament control over the king's ministers. Finally, the Parliament passed a law forbidding the King to dissolve it without its consent, even if the three years were up. Ever since, this Parliament has been known as the &quot;Long Parliament&quot;. However, Parliament did attempt to avert conflict by requiring all adults to sign [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], an oath of allegiance to Charles.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Walter|1999|p=294}}, for some of the complexities of how the Protestation was interpreted by different political actors.&lt;/ref&gt;\nEarly in the Long Parliament's proceedings the house overwhelmingly accused [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford]] of high treason and other crimes and misdemeanours.\n[[Henry Vane the Younger]] supplied evidence in relation to Strafford's claimed improper use of the army in Ireland, alleging that Strafford was encouraging the King to use his army raised in Ireland to threaten England into compliance. This evidence was obtained from Vane's father, [[Henry Vane the Elder]], a member of the King's Privy council, who refused to confirm it in Parliament out of loyalty to Charles. On 10 April 1641, Pym's case collapsed, but Pym made a direct appeal to [[Henry Vane the Younger]] to produce a copy of the notes from the King's Privy council, discovered by the younger Vane and secretly turned over to Pym, to the great anguish of the Elder Vane.&lt;ref name=Upham187&gt;{{harvnb|Upham|1842|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These notes from the King's Privy Council contained evidence Strafford had told the King, &quot;Sir, you have done your duty, and your subjects have failed in theirs; and therefore you are absolved from the rules of government, and may supply yourself by extraordinary ways; you have an army in Ireland, with which you may reduce the kingdom.&quot;{{sfn|Upham|1842|p=187}}{{sfn|Hibbert|1968|p=154}}{{sfn|Carlton|1995|p=224}}\nPym immediately launched a Bill of Attainder, stating Strafford's guilt and demanding that the Earl be put to death.{{sfn|Carlton|1995|p=224}} Unlike a guilty finding in a court case, attainder did not require a [[legal burden of proof]], but it did require [[Royal Assent|the king's approval]]. Charles, however, guaranteed Strafford that he would not sign the attainder, without which the bill could not be passed.{{sfn|Carlton|1995|p=225}} Furthermore, the Lords were opposed to the severity of the sentence of death imposed upon Strafford. Yet, increased tensions and [[First Army Plot|a plot]] in the army to support Strafford began to sway the issue.{{sfn|Carlton|1995|p=225}} On 21 April,  the Commons passed the Bill (204 in favour, 59 opposed, and 250 abstained),{{sfn|Smith|1999|p=123}} and the Lords acquiesced. Charles, still incensed over the Commons' handling of Buckingham, refused. Strafford himself, hoping to head off the war he saw looming, wrote to the king and asked him to reconsider.&lt;ref name=Abbott&gt;{{cite book |first=Jacob |last=Abbott |url=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=abbott&amp;book=charles1&amp;story=_contents |title=Charles I |chapter=Chapter: Downfall of Strafford and Laud |chapterurl=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=abbott&amp;book=charles1&amp;story=downfall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles, fearing for the safety of his family, signed on 10 May.{{sfn|Smith|1999|p=123}}  Strafford was beheaded two days later.{{sfn|Coward|1994|p=191}} In the meantime both Parliament and the King agreed to an independent investigation into the king's involvement in Strafford's plot.\nThe Long Parliament then passed the [[Triennial Act]], also known as the [[Dissolution Act]] in May 1641, to which the Royal Assent was readily granted.{{sfn|Carlton|1995|p=222}}{{sfn|Kenyon|1978|p=127}} The Triennial Act required that Parliament be summoned at least once every three years, and that when the King failed to issue proper summons, the members could assemble on their own.  This act also forbade ship money without Parliament's consent, fines in destraint of knighthood and forced loans. Monopolies were cut back severely, and the Courts of [[Star Chamber]] and [[Court of High Commission|High Commission]] were abolished by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]] and the Triennial Act respectively.{{sfn|Gregg|1981|p= 335}} All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act.{{sfn|Kenyon|1978|p=129}} On 3 May, Parliament decreed [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], attacking the 'wicked counsels' of Charles's government, whereby those who signed the petition undertook to defend 'the true reformed religion', parliament, and the king's person, honour and estate. Throughout May, the House of Commons launched several bills attacking bishops and episcopalianism in general, each time defeated in the Lords.{{sfn|Kenyon|1978|p=130}}&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Abbott ''[http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=abbott&amp;book=charles1&amp;story=_contents Charles I]'' Chapter ''[http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=abbott&amp;book=charles1&amp;story=downfall Downfall of Strafford and Laud]''&lt;/ref&gt;\nIt was hoped by both Charles and Parliament that the execution of Strafford and the Protestation would end the drift towards war; in fact, they encouraged it. Charles and his supporters continued to resent Parliament's demands, while Parliamentarians continued to suspect Charles of wanting to impose episcopalianism and unfettered royal rule by military force. Within months, the Irish Catholics, fearing a resurgence of Protestant power, [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|struck first]], and all Ireland soon descended into chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|pp=109���113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rumours circulated that the King supported the Irish, and Puritan members of the Commons soon started murmuring that this exemplified the fate that Charles had in store for them all.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=113}} for the concerns of a similar English Catholic rising.&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn early January 1642, accompanied by 400 soldiers, Charles attempted to arrest five members of the House of Commons on a charge of treason.&lt;ref name=Sherwood-1997-41&gt;{{Harvnb|Sherwood|1997|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This attempt failed. When the troops marched into Parliament, Charles enquired of [[William Lenthall]], the [[List of Speakers of the House of Commons of England|Speaker]], as to the whereabouts of the five. Lenthall replied, &quot;May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sherwood-1997-41/&gt; In other words, the Speaker proclaimed himself a servant of Parliament, rather than of the King.&lt;ref name=Sherwood-1997-41/&gt;\n===Local grievances===\nIn the summer of 1642 these national troubles helped to polarise opinion, ending indecision about which side to support or what action to take. Opposition to Charles also arose owing to many local grievances. For example, the imposition of drainage-schemes in [[The Fens]] negatively affected the livelihood of thousands of people after the King awarded a number of drainage-contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|1991|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many regarded the King as indifferent to the welfare of the people, and this played a role in bringing a large part of eastern England into Parliament���s camp. This sentiment brought with it people such as the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]], each a notable wartime adversary of the King. Conversely, one of the leading drainage contractors, the [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Earl of Lindsey]], was to die fighting for the King at the [[Battle of Edgehill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=180}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\n==First English Civil War (1642���1646)==\n[[File:English civil war map 1642 to 1645.JPG|thumb|220px|Maps of territory held by Royalists (red) and Parliamentarians (yellow), 1642���1645]]\n{{Main|First English Civil War}}\nIn early January 1642, a few days after his failure to capture five members of the House of Commons, fearing for the safety of his family and retinue, Charles left the London area for the north of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further negotiations by frequent correspondence between the King and the [[Long Parliament]] through to early summer proved fruitless. As the summer progressed, cities and towns declared their sympathies for one faction or the other: for example, the garrison of Portsmouth under the command of Sir [[George Goring, Lord Goring|George Goring]] declared for the King,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but when Charles tried to acquire arms for his cause from [[Kingston upon Hull]], the depository for the weapons used in the previous Scottish campaigns, Sir [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|John Hotham]], the military governor appointed by Parliament in January, refused to let Charles enter Hull,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and when Charles returned with more men later, [[Siege of Hull (1642)|Hotham drove them off]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wedgwood 1970 100&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles issued a warrant for Hotham to be arrested as a traitor but was powerless to enforce it. Throughout the summer months, tensions rose and there was brawling in a number of places, with the first death from the conflict taking place in Manchester.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wedgwood 1970 100&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|pp=158���166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\nAt the outset of the conflict, much of the country remained neutral, though the [[Royal Navy]] and most English cities favoured Parliament, while the King found considerable support in rural communities. Historians estimate that between them, both sides had only about 15,000 men.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However, the war quickly spread and eventually involved every level of society. Many areas attempted to remain neutral. Some formed bands of [[Clubmen]] to protect their localities against the worst excesses of the armies of both sides,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|pp=403,4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but most found it impossible to withstand both the King and Parliament. On one side, the King and his supporters fought for traditional government in Church and state. On the other, most supporters of the Parliamentary cause initially took up arms to defend what they thought of as the traditional balance of government in Church and state, which the bad advice the King had received from his advisers had undermined before and during the &quot;Eleven Years' Tyranny.&quot; The views of the Members of Parliament ranged from unquestioning support of the King ��� at one point during the First Civil War, more members of the Commons and Lords gathered in the King's [[Oxford Parliament (1644)|Oxford Parliament]] than at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] ��� through to radicals, who wanted major reforms in favour of [[Nonconformism|religious independence]] and the redistribution of power at the national level.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}&lt;!--For the whole paragraph--&gt; However, even the most radical supporters of the Parliamentarian cause still favoured the retention of Charles on the throne.\nAfter the [[debacle at Hull]], Charles moved on to [[Nottingham]], where on 22 August 1642, he raised the [[Royal Standard of England|royal standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When he raised his standard, Charles had with him about 2,000 cavalry and a small number of Yorkshire infantry-men, and using the archaic system of a [[Commission of Array]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles's supporters started to build a larger army around the standard. Charles moved in a south-westerly direction, first to [[Stafford]], and then on to [[Shrewsbury]], because the support for his cause seemed particularly strong in the [[River Severn|Severn]] valley area and in [[North Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|pp=170,183}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While passing through [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], in what became known as the &quot;[[Wellington Declaration]],&quot; he declared that he would uphold the &quot;Protestant religion, the laws of England, and the liberty of Parliament.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sherwood|1992|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:Battle of Marston Moor, 1644.png|left|thumb|The [[Battle of Marston Moor]], 1644]]\nThe Parliamentarians who opposed the King had not remained passive during this pre-war period. As in the case of Kingston upon Hull, they had taken measures to secure strategic towns and cities by appointing to office men sympathetic to their cause, and on 9 June they had voted to raise an army of 10,000 volunteers and appointed [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex]] commander three days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|pp=108,9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He received orders &quot;to rescue His Majesty's person, and the persons of the [[Charles II of England|Prince [of Wales]]] and the [[James II of England|Duke of York]] out of the hands of those desperate persons who were about them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1993|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lord Lieutenant|Lords Lieutenant]], whom Parliament appointed, used the [[Militia Ordinance]] to order the militia to join Essex's army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|pp=165,161}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\nTwo weeks after the King had raised his standard at Nottingham, Essex led his army north towards [[Northampton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; picking up support along the way (including a detachment of [[Cambridgeshire]] cavalry raised and commanded by [[Oliver Cromwell]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cromwell had already secured Cambridge and the supplies of college silver ��� see {{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of September Essex's forces had grown to 21,000 infantry and 4,200 cavalry and [[dragoon]]s. On 14 September he moved his army to [[Coventry]] and then to the north of the [[Cotswolds]],&lt;ref&gt;Wegwood, p.115.&lt;/ref&gt; a strategy which placed his army between the Royalists and London. With the size of both armies now in the tens of thousands, and only Worcestershire between them, it was inevitable that cavalry reconnaissance units would sooner or later meet. This happened in the first major skirmish of the Civil War, when a cavalry troop of about 1,000 Royalists commanded by [[Prince Rupert]], a German nephew of the King and one of the outstanding cavalry commanders of the war,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; defeated a Parliamentary cavalry detachment under the command of Colonel [[John Brown (soldier)|John Brown]] in the [[Battle of Powick Bridge]], at a bridge across the [[River Teme]] close to [[Worcester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|pp=171���188}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:Rupert of the Rhine.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]]]\nRupert withdrew to Shrewsbury, where a council-of-war discussed two courses of action: whether to advance towards Essex's new position near [[Worcester]], or to march along the now opened road towards London. The Council decided to take the London route, but not to avoid a battle, for the Royalist generals wanted to fight Essex before he grew too strong, and the temper of both sides made it impossible to postpone the decision. In the [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon's]] words: &quot;it was considered more counsellable to march towards London, it being morally sure that Essex would put himself in their way&quot;.&lt;ref name=EB11-GR&gt;[[Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] Great Rebellion&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the army left Shrewsbury on 12 October, gaining two days' start on the enemy, and moved south-east.

In the same year, Oliver Cromwell formed his troop of &quot;[[Ironside (cavalry)|Ironsides]]&quot;, a disciplined unit that demonstrated his military leadership ability.

The turning point came in the late summer and early autumn of 1643, when the Earl of Essex's army forced the king to raise the [[siege of Gloucester]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and then brushed the Royalist army aside at the [[First Battle of Newbury]] (20 September 1643),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=238}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to return triumphantly to London. Other Parliamentarian forces won the [[Battle of Winceby]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=248}}.&lt;/ref&gt; giving them control of [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]].

[[John Calvin]] formulated a doctrine of [[Presbyterianism]], which held that in the New Testament the offices of ''presbyter'' and ''episkopos'' were identical; he rejected the doctrine of [[apostolic succession]]. Calvin's follower [[John Knox]] brought Presbyterianism to [[Scotland]] when the Scottish church was reformed in 1560. In practice, Presbyterianism meant that committees of lay elders had a substantial voice in church government, as opposed to merely being subjects to a ruling [[hierarchy]].\nThis vision of at least partial [[democracy]] in [[ecclesiology]] paralleled the struggles between [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and [[List of English monarchs|the King]]. A body within the [[Puritan]] movement in the [[Church of England]] sought to abolish the office of bishop and remake the Church of England along Presbyterian lines. The [[Martin Marprelate]] tracts (1588���89), applying the [[pejorative]] name of ''[[prelate|prelacy]]'' to the church hierarchy, attacked the office of bishop with satire that deeply offended [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and her [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]]. The [[vestments controversy]] also related to this movement, seeking further reductions in church ceremony, and labelling the use of elaborate vestments as &quot;unedifying&quot; and even [[idolatry and Christianity|idolatrous]].\n[[James I of England|King James I]], reacting against the perceived contumacy of his Presbyterian Scottish subjects, adopted &quot;No Bishop, no King&quot; as a slogan; he tied the hierarchical authority of the bishop to the absolute authority he sought as king, and viewed attacks on the authority of the bishops as attacks on his own authority. Matters came to a head when King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] appointed [[William Laud]] as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]; Laud aggressively attacked the Presbyterian movement and sought to impose the full [[Book of Common Prayer|Anglican liturgy]]. The controversy eventually led to Laud's [[impeachment]] for [[treason]] by a [[bill of attainder]] in 1645, and subsequent execution. Charles also attempted to impose episcopacy on Scotland; the Scots' violent rejection of bishops and liturgical worship sparked the [[Bishops' Wars]] in 1639���1640.\nDuring the height of Puritan power in [[Commonwealth of England|the Commonwealth]] and [[the Protectorate]], episcopacy was formally abolished in the Church of England on 9 October 1646.{{sfn|King|1968|p=523���537}} The Church of England remained Presbyterian until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plant|2002|loc=}}. {{better source|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n===English overseas possessions===\n{{details|English overseas possessions in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms}}\n{{expand section|date=November 2013}}\nDuring the period of the English Civil War, the English overseas possessions were highly involved.

There are no accurate figures for these periods, and it is not possible to give a precise overall figure for those killed in battle, as opposed to those who died from disease, or even from a natural decline in population.\nFigures for casualties during this period are unreliable, but some attempt has been made to provide rough estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|2012|loc=}}. {{better source|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carlton-211-214&gt;{{Harvnb|Carlton|1992|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&amp;pg=PP10&amp;lpg=PP9&amp;ots=R_1h4VBt52&amp;dq=Going+to+the+Wars&amp;lr=&amp;sig=jeEvvoXbdxT3_3ioIDjDA7GWqwQ#PPA211,M1 pp. 211 ��� 214]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn England, a conservative estimate is that roughly 100,000 people died from war-related disease during the three civil wars.

Many of those sold to landowners in New England eventually prospered, but many of those sold to landowners in the West Indies were worked to death.\nThese estimates indicate that England suffered a 3.7% loss of population, Scotland a loss of 6%, while Ireland suffered a loss of 41% of its population. Putting these numbers into the context of other catastrophes helps to understand the devastation to Ireland in particular.

In the wake of victory, many of the ideals (and many of the idealists) became sidelined. The republican government of the [[Commonwealth of England]] ruled England (and later all of Scotland and Ireland) from 1649 to 1653 and from 1659 to 1660. Between the two periods, and due to in-fighting amongst various factions in Parliament, [[Oliver Cromwell]] ruled over [[the Protectorate]] as [[Lord Protector]] (effectively a military dictator) until his death in 1658.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Sherwood|1997|pp=7���11}} for a longer analysis of the relationship between Cromwell's position, the former monarchy and the military.&lt;/ref&gt;\nUpon his death, Oliver Cromwell's son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] became Lord Protector, but the Army had little confidence in him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keeble|2002|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After seven months the Army removed Richard, and in May 1659 it re-installed the Rump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keeble|2002|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the Rump Parliament acted as though nothing had changed since 1653 and as though it could treat the Army as it liked, military force shortly afterwards dissolved this, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keeble|2002|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the second dissolution of the Rump, in October 1659, the prospect of a total descent into anarchy loomed as the Army's pretence of unity finally dissolved into factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keeble|2002|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:Musket volley by Sealed Knot.JPG|thumb|left|A historical civil war re-enactment]]\nInto this atmosphere General [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|George Monck]], Governor of Scotland under the Cromwells, marched south with his army from Scotland.

It was no coincidence that the United Kingdom was spared the wave of revolutions that occurred in Europe in the 1840s. Specifically, future monarchs became wary of pushing Parliament too hard, and Parliament effectively chose the line of royal succession in 1688 with the [[Glorious Revolution]] and in the 1701 [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]]. After the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], Parliament's factions became political parties (later becoming the [[Tory|Tories]] and [[Whig (UK)|Whigs]]) with competing views and varying abilities to influence the decisions of their monarchs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}&lt;!--For the whole paragraph--&gt;\n==Historiography and explanations==\nIn the early decades of the 20th century the [[Whig history|Whig school]] was the dominant theoretical view. They explained the Civil War as resulting from a centuries-long struggle between Parliament (especially the House of Commons) and the Monarchy, with Parliament defending the traditional rights of Englishmen, while the Stuart monarchy continually attempted to expand its right to arbitrarily dictate law. The most important Whig historian, [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner|S.R. Gardiner]], popularised the English Civil War as a 'Puritan Revolution': challenging the repressive Stuart Church, and preparing the way for [[religious toleration]] in the Restoration. Thus, Puritanism was the natural ally of a people preserving their traditional rights against arbitrary monarchical power.\nThe Whig view was challenged and largely superseded by the [[Marxism|Marxist]] school, which became popular in the 1940s, and which interpreted the English Civil War as a [[bourgeois]] revolution. According to Marxist historian [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]:\n{{quote|The Civil War was a class war, in which the despotism of Charles I was defended by the reactionary forces of the established Church and conservative landlords, Parliament beat the King because it could appeal to the enthusiastic support of the trading and industrial classes in town and countryside, to the yeomen and progressive gentry, and to wider masses of the population whenever they were able by free discussion to understand what the struggle was really about.|Christopher Hill&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaye|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=w6xVLvqihBoC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5dICTMP1BM6TkAWVioS2DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 106]}} quoting Hill from his pamphlet ''The English Revolution 1640''&lt;/ref&gt;}}\nIn the 1970s, [[historical revisionism|revisionist historians]] challenged both the Whig and the Marxist theories,&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;{{harvnb|Burgess|1990|pp=609���627}}.&lt;/ref&gt; notably in the 1973 anthology ''The Origins of the English Civil War'' ([[Conrad Russell]] ed.). These historians produced work focused on the minutiae of the years immediately preceding the civil war, thereby returning to the contingency-based historiography of [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon's]] famous contemporary history ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England''. This, it was claimed, demonstrated that factional war-allegiance patterns did not fit either Whig or Marxist history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaunt|2000|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament was not inherently progressive, with the events of 1640 a precursor for the [[Glorious Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gaunt|2000|pp=60, 61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; nor did Puritans necessarily ally themselves with Parliamentarians.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  Many members of the bourgeoisie fought for the King, while many landed aristocrats supported Parliament. Thus, revisionist historians claim to have discredited some Whig and Marxist interpretations of the English Civil War.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2008}}\nFrom the 1990s, a number of historians discarded and replaced the historical title &quot;English Civil War&quot; with the titles the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and the &quot;British Civil Wars&quot;, positing that the civil war in England cannot be understood isolated from events in other parts of Great Britain and Ireland; King Charles I remains crucial, not just as King of England, but also because of his relationship with the peoples of his other realms. For example, the wars began when King Charles I tried imposing an Anglican Prayer Book upon Scotland, and when this was met with resistance from the [[Covenanter]]s, he needed an army to impose his will. However, this forced him to call an English Parliament to raise new taxes to pay for the army. The English Parliaments were not willing to grant Charles the revenue he needed to pay for the Scottish expeditionary army unless he addressed their grievances. By the early 1640s, Charles was left in a state of near permanent crisis management; often he was not willing to concede enough ground to any one faction to neutralise the threat, and in some circumstances to do so would only antagonise another faction. For example, Charles finally agreed upon terms with the Covenanters in August 1641, but although this might have weakened the position of the English Parliament, the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] broke out in October 1641, largely negating the political advantage he had obtained by relieving himself of the cost of the Scottish invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlmeyer, Jane.

As his perspective was so much at odds with other views, Hobbes struggled to understand the thinking of most of his potential audience and people in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  For instance, he accredits the Presbyterians and Parliamentarians with &quot;improbably long-planned and wicked ambitions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; What���s more, &quot;he hardly understands the orthodox Royalists (he was himself a highly unorthodox Royalist) any better, and he makes only limited concessions of sincerity to the religious feelings of the various parties&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;\n==Re-enactments==\n[[File:Civil war reeanactment.JPG|thumb|right|A historical civil war re-enactment]]\nTwo large historical societies exist, [[The Sealed Knot (reenactment)|The Sealed Knot]] and [[The English Civil War Society]], which regularly [[English Civil War reenactment|re-enact]] events and battles of the Civil War in full period costume.\n==See also==\n*[[Timeline of the English Civil War]], showing events leading up to, culminating in, and resulting from the English Civil Wars.\n*[[First English Civil War, 1642]]\n*[[First English Civil War, 1643]]\n*[[First English Civil War, 1644]]\n*[[First English Civil War, 1645]]\n*[[First English Civil War, 1646]]\n*[[Cromwell's Soldiers' Pocket Bible]], booklet Cromwell issued to his army in 1643.\n*[[English Dissenters]]\n*[[William Hiseland]], the last Royalist veteran of the Civil War\n*[[Thirty Years' War]], a defining event in European history during the reign of Charles I.\n*The [[Levellers]], a movement for power reform.\n*[[Diggers]]\n&lt;!-- * [[Tyne-Wear rivalry#Origins of the rivalry]] --Needs a source that the Tyne-Wear rivalry is partially based on the Civil War and not just on FTM --&gt;\n{{clear}}\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Citation| last=Aylmer |first=G.
