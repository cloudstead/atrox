Just days later on 16 August 1851, Lieutenant-Governor [[Charles La Trobe|Latrobe]] proclaimed in the Government Gazette crown rights for all mining proceeds and a licence fee of 30 shillings per month effective from 1 September 1851.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roymorgan.com/resources/pdf/papers/20110502.pdf Charles La Trobe, Victoria's Separation &amp; Gold Tax ��� 'turning a wild colonial country into a civilised one'] Roy Morgan Research&lt;/ref&gt;\nOn 26 August, a rally of 40-50 miners opposing the fee was held at Hiscock's gully ��� the first of many such protests in the colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;Argus 30 Aug 1851&quot;&gt;GOLD.

The government hastily repealed its plans due to the reaction.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}\nNevertheless, the oppressive licence hunts continued and increased in frequency causing general dissent among the diggers. In addition, Weston Bate noted that the Ballarat diggings were in strong opposition to the strict liquor licensing laws imposed by the government.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}\nChanges to the Goldfields Act in 1853 allowed licence searches to occur at any time which further incensed the diggers. In [[Bendigo]] in 1853, an [[Anti-Gold Licence Association]] was formed and the miners were apparently on the brink of an armed clash with authorities.

The meeting resolved to establish a 'Digger's Rights Society', to protect their rights. On 1 November 1854, 3,000 miners met once again at Bakery Hill. They were addressed by Thomas Kennedy, Henry Holyoake, George Black and [[Henry Ross]]. The diggers were further angered by the arrest of another seven of their number for the Eureka Hotel fire.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}\n=== Ballarat Reform League ===\n{{Main|Ballarat Reform League}}\nOn Saturday, 11 November 1854 a crowd estimated at more than 10,000 miners gathered at [[Bakery Hill, Victoria|Bakery Hill]], directly opposite the government encampment. At this meeting, the Ballarat Reform League was created, under the chairmanship of [[Chartism|Chartist]] [[John Basson Humffray]]. Several other Reform League leaders, including Kennedy and Holyoake, had been involved with the Chartist movement in England. Many of the miners had past involvement in the Chartist movement and the social upheavals in Britain, Ireland, and continental Europe during the 1840s.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}\n[[File:Charles Hotham by James Henry Lynch-crop.jpg|thumb|left|The Ballarat Reform League sought to negotiate with Commissioner [[Robert William Rede|Robert Rede]] and the [[Governor of Victoria]], [[Charles Hotham|Sir Charles Hotham]] ''(pictured)'']]\nIn setting its goals, the Ballarat Reform League used the British Chartist movement's principles.

Governor Hotham, on 16 November 1854, appointed a Royal Commission on goldfields problems and grievances.  However, Commissioner Rede, rather than hear miner's grievances, increased the police presence in the gold fields and summoned reinforcements from Melbourne.  Many historians (most notably [[Manning Clark]]) attribute this to his belief in his right to exert authority over the &quot;rabble.&quot;{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}\nOn 28 November 1854, the reinforcements marching from Melbourne were attacked by a crowd of miners. A number were injured and a drummer boy was allegedly killed. The rumour of the drummer boy's death was perpetuated, even with a memorial erected to him in Ballarat Cemetery for many years, although historical research has shown that the boy, John Egan, continued military service until dying in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~garter1/drummerboy.htm Drummer Boy John Egan (Regiment No. 3059) Eureka's first Military Casualty].

A further two hundred Americans, the Independent Californian Rangers, under the leadership of James McGill, arrived about 4pm. The Americans were armed with revolvers and Mexican knives and possessed horses. In a fateful decision, McGill decided to take most of the Californian Rangers away from the stockade to intercept rumoured British reinforcements coming from Melbourne. Rede's spies observed these actions. That night many of the miners went back to their own tents after the traditional Saturday night carousing, with the assumption that the Queen's military forces would not be sent to attack on the Sabbath (Sunday).

The ramshackle army of miners was hopelessly outclassed by a military regiment and was routed in about 10 minutes.

Thousands of people in Melbourne turned out to condemn the authorities, in defiance of their mayor and some Legislative Councillors, who tried to rally support for the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;ballaratreformleague1&quot;&gt;The Eureka Stockade : Gateway to Democracy ��� by Weston Bate (Historian) http://www.ballaratreformleague.org.au/ballarat.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In Ballarat, only one man responded to the call for special constables,&lt;ref name=&quot;ballaratreformleague1&quot;/&gt; although in Melbourne 1500 were sworn in and armed with batons.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Proctor: Convict, Pioneer and Settler By Jeff Atkinson&lt;/ref&gt; Many people voiced their support for the diggers' requested reforms.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\nExact numbers of deaths and injuries and persons are difficult to determine as many miners &quot;fled to the surrounding bush and it is likely a good many more died a lonely death or suffered the agony of their wounds, hidden from the authorities for fear of repercussions.&quot; according to Eureka researcher and author Dorothy Wickham.

Seekamp was arrested in his newspaper office on 4 December 1854, for a series of articles that appeared in the ''Ballarat Times''. Many of these articles were written by George Lang, the son of the prominent republican and Presbyterian Minister of Sydney, the Reverend [[John Dunmore Lang]]. He was tried and convicted of seditious libel by a Melbourne jury on 23 January 1855 and, after a series of appeals, sentenced to six months imprisonment on 23 March. He was released from prison on 28 June 1855, precisely three months early.\nOf the approximately 120 'diggers' detained after the rebellion, thirteen were brought to trial.

According to Blainey, &quot;It was perhaps the most generous concession offered by a governor to a major opponent in the history of Australia up to that time. The members of the commission were appointed before Eureka...they were men who were likely to be sympathetic to the diggers.&quot;\nThe report made several major recommendations, one of which was to restrict Chinese immigration. Its recommendations were only put into effect after the Stockade. The [[Miner's Licence|gold licences]] were then abolished, and replaced by an annual [[Miner's Right|miner's right]] and an export fee based on the value of the gold. Mining wardens replaced the gold commissioners, and police numbers were cut drastically. The Legislative Council was expanded to allow representation to the major goldfields and [[Peter Lalor]] and [[John Basson Humffray]] were elected for Ballarat, although there were property qualifications with regards to eligibility to vote in upper house elections in Victoria until the 1950s. After 12 months, all but one of the demands of the Ballarat Reform League had been granted. Lalor and Humffray both enjoyed distinguished careers as politicians, with Lalor later elected as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria.\n=== Peter Lalor ===\n{{Main|Peter Lalor}}\n[[File:Peter Lalor as Speaker.jpg|thumb|upright|Eureka leader [[Peter Lalor]] in later life as Speaker of the House in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria]]\nFollowing the battle, rebel leader, [[Irish Australian]] Peter Lalor, wrote in a statement to the colonists of Victoria, &quot;There are two things connected with the late outbreak (Eureka) which I deeply regret. The first is, that we shouldn't have been forced to take up arms at all; and the second is, that when we were compelled to take the field in our own defence, we were unable (through want of arms, ammunition and a little organisation) to inflict on the real authors of the outbreak the punishment they so richly deserved.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web\n| last =Lalor\n| first =Peter\n| authorlink =Peter Lalor\n| title =Peter Lalor's Narrative\n| work =Eureka on Trial\n| publisher =Public Record Office Victoria, (2003)\n| year =1855\n| url =http://eureka.imagineering.com.au/lalors_letter.htm\n| accessdate =21 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;\nLalor stood for Ballarat in the 1856 elections and was elected unopposed. As he was the Eureka hero his policies were not scrutinised at all before the election.\nDuring a speech in the Legislative Council in 1856 he said, &quot;I would ask these gentlemen what they mean by the term 'democracy'. Do they mean Chartism or Republicanism? If so, I never was, I am not now, nor do I ever intend to be a democrat. But if a democrat means opposition to a tyrannical press, a tyrannical people, or a tyrannical government, then I have been, I am still, and will ever remain a democrat.&quot;\nHistorians, including Weston Bate suggested that there was some hypocrisy in Lalor's folk hero status due to his post-stockade political opportunism and self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Bate, Weston. &quot;Lucky City&quot;.

Page 133&lt;/ref&gt;\n===Debate regarding political significance===\nThe actual significance of Eureka upon Australia's politics is not decisive. It has been variously mythologised by particular interest groups as a revolt of free men against imperial tyranny, of independent free enterprise against burdensome taxation, of labour against a privileged ruling class, or as an expression of [[Republicanism in Australia|republicanism]],  yet the writings of [[Raffaello Carboni]], who was present at the Stockade, make it clear that &quot;amongst the foreigners&amp;nbsp;... there was no democratic feeling, but merely a spirit of resistance to the licence fee&quot;; and he also disputes the accusations &quot;that have branded the miners of Ballarat as disloyal to their QUEEN&quot; (emphasis as in the original).&lt;ref&gt;RC:108,153&lt;/ref&gt; The affair continues to raise echoes in Australian politics to the present day, and from time to time one group or another calls for the existing Australian flag to be replaced by the Eureka Flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/eureka-an-answer-to-that-jack-in-the-corner-gets-a-little-bit-warmer-20110125-1a4be.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Eureka?

Sculpted in stone from the [[Barrabool Hills]] by James Leggatt in Geelong it features a pillar bearing the names of the deceased miners and bearing the inscription &quot;Sacred to the memory of those who fell on the memorable 3rd of December, 1854, in resisting the unconstitutional proceedings of the Victorian Government.&quot;\nA soldiers' memorial was erected many years later in 1876 and is an obelisk constructed of limestone sourced from [[Waurn Ponds]] with the words &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Duty&quot; carved in its north and south faces respectively. In 1879 a cast iron fence was added to the memorials and graves.\nOver the next thirty years, press interest in the events that had taken place at the Eureka Stockade dwindled, but Eureka was kept alive at the campfires and in the pubs, and in memorial events in Ballarat.

Other scenes in the lost reels of the film were believed to have included gold seekers leaving London, issuing of licences, licence hunting, diggers chained to logs and rescued by mates, diggers burning Bentley's Hotel, the Rebellion, building the stockade, troops storming the stockade and the stockade in ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web\n|title=Eureka Stockade (1907)\n|publisher=[[National Film and Sound Archive]]\n|url=http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/summary/summary.w3p;adv=yes;group=;groupequals=;page=0;parentid=;query=Eureka%20Stockade%20Media%3A%22FILM%20%22%20%7C%20Media%3A%22TELEVISION%22;querytype=;resCount=10\n|accessdate=28 June 2013\n}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n''[[The Loyal Rebel]]'', also known as ''Eureka Stockade'', is an Australian silent film made in 1915.
