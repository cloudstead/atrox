The surprise attack caught the [[Allies (WWII)|Allied]] forces completely off guard. United States forces bore the brunt of the attack and incurred their highest casualties for any operation during the war. The battle also severely depleted Germany's armored forces on the western front, and Germany was largely unable to replace them. German personnel, and later Luftwaffe aircraft (in [[Operation Bodenplatte|the concluding stages of the engagement]]), also sustained heavy losses.\nDifferent forces referred to the battle by different names. The Germans referred to it officially as '''Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein''' (&quot;Operation Watch on the Rhine&quot;) or usually '''Ardennenoffensive''' or '''Rundstedt-Offensive''', while the French named it the '''Bataille des Ardennes''' (&quot;Battle of the Ardennes&quot;). The Allies called it the '''Ardennes Counteroffensive'''.  The phrase &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; was coined by contemporary press to describe the way the Allied front line bulged inward on wartime news maps{{sfn|Cirillo|2003|p=4}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Eggenberger|1985}} cites the official name as Ardennes-Alsace campaign; David Eggenberger describes this battle as the &quot;Second Battle of the Ardennes&quot;.}}{{sfn|Stanton|2006|p={{Page needed|date=November 2014}}}} and became the most widely used name for the battle.\nThe German offensive was supported by several subordinate actions including Operations [[Operation Bodenplatte|Unternehmen Bodenplatte]], [[Operation Greif|Greif]] and [[Operation Wahrung|Währung]]. As well as stopping Allied transport over the channel to the port city of Antwerp, these operations were intended to split the British and American [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] line in half, so the Germans could then proceed to [[encirclement|encircle and destroy]] four Allied armies, forcing the [[Western Allies]] to negotiate a [[peace treaty]] in the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis Powers]]' favor. Once that was accomplished, Hitler could fully concentrate on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern theatre of war]].\nThe offensive was planned by the German forces with utmost secrecy, minimizing radio traffic and moving troops and equipment under cover of darkness. [[Ultra (cryptography)|Intercepted]] German communications indicating a substantial German offensive preparation were not acted upon by the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;''Top Secret Ultra'' by [[Peter Calvocoressi]] (1980, Cassell, London) p. 48 ISBN 0-304-30546-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Days: Code-breaking in Bletchley Park'' by [[Asa Briggs]] (2011, Frontline Books, London) pp. 122–3 ISBN 978-1-84832-615-6&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe Germans achieved total surprise on the morning of 16 December 1944 due to a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor [[aerial reconnaissance]]. The Germans attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line, taking advantage of heavily overcast weather conditions, which grounded the Allies' overwhelmingly superior air forces. Fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive around [[Battle of Elsenborn Ridge|Elsenborn Ridge]] and in the south around [[Bastogne]] blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success. Columns of armor and infantry that were supposed to advance along parallel routes found themselves on the same roads. This and terrain that favored the defenders threw the German advance behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops. Improved weather conditions permitted air attacks on German forces and [[supply line]]s, which sealed the failure of the offensive. In the wake of the defeat, many experienced German units were left severely depleted of men and equipment, as survivors retreated to the defenses of the [[Siegfried Line]].\nThe Germans' initial attack included 200,000 men, 340 tanks and 280 assault guns. These were reinforced a couple weeks later, bringing the offensive's total strength to 300,000 troops, 1,500+ tanks and assault guns, 2,400 aircraft, and several thousand field guns and mortars. Between 67,200 and 125,000 of their men were killed, missing or wounded. For the Americans, 610,000 men were involved in the battle,{{sfn|Cirillo|2003|p=53}} of whom 89,000 were casualties,{{sfn|Miles|2004}} including up to 19,000 killed.{{sfn|Miles|2004}}{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=618}} Along with the [[Battle of Okinawa]] and the [[Battle of Luzon]], it was one of the largest and bloodiest battles fought by the United States in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=McCullough, David |year=2005 |title=American Experience – The Battle of the Bulge|medium=Videotape}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ambrose1997&gt;{{citation |first=Stephen E. |last=Ambrose |year=1997 |title=Americans at War |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |page=52 |isbn=978-1-57806-026-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Donald L. |last=Miller |year=2002 |title=The Story of World War II |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=358 |isbn=978-0-7432-1198-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n==Background==\nAfter the [[Operation Cobra|breakout from Normandy]] at the end of July 1944 and the [[Operation Dragoon|landings in southern France]] on 15 August 1944, the Allies advanced toward Germany more quickly than anticipated.{{efn|Operation Overlord planned for an advance to the line of the Seine by D+90 (i.e., the 90th day following [[D-Day]]) and an advance to the German frontier sometime after D+120.}} The Allies were faced with several [[military logistics]] issues: troops were fatigued by weeks of continuous combat, supply lines were stretched extremely thin, and supplies were dangerously depleted. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] (the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Allied Commander]]) and his staff chose to hold the [[Ardennes]] region which was occupied by the First United States Army. The Allies believed the Ardennes could be defended by as few troops as possible due to the favorable terrain (a densely wooded highland with deep river valleys and a rather thin road network) and a limited number of Allied operational objectives. Also, the [[Wehrmacht]] was known to be using the area to the east across the German border (the Eifel region, which is the geological continuation of the Ardennes) as a rest-and-refit area for its troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fabianich&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.benning.army.mil/monographs/content/wwii/STUP2/FabianichKeith%20P.%20MAJ.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Operations of the 3rd Battalion, 395th Infantry (99th Infantry Division) Prior to and During the German Counter-Offensive, 10 November – 24 December 1944 (Ardennes Campaign) (Personal Experience of a Company Commander and Battalion Operations Officer) |last=Fabianich |first=Maj.

The only deep-water port the Allies had captured was [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] on the northern shore of the Cotentin peninsula and west of the original invasion beaches,{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=1088–1089}} but the Germans had thoroughly wrecked and mined the harbor before it could be taken. It took many months to rebuild its cargo-handling capability. The Allies captured the [[port of Antwerp]] intact in the first days of September, but it was not operational until 28 November. The estuary of the Schelde river (also called [[Scheldt]]) that controlled access to the port had to be cleared of both German troops and [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=1086}} The limitations led to differences between General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Field Marshal [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] over whether Montgomery or American General [[Omar Bradley]] in the south would get priority access to supplies.{{sfn|Ryan|1995|p=68}}\nGerman forces remained in control of several major ports on the [[English Channel]] coast until May 1945. The extensive [[Transport Plan|destruction of the French railway system]] prior to D-Day, successful in hampering German response to the invasion, proved equally damaging to the Allies, as it took time to repair the system's tracks and bridges. A trucking system nicknamed the [[Red Ball Express]] brought supplies to front-line troops, but used up five times as much fuel to reach the front line near the Belgian border as was delivered. By early October, the Allies had suspended major offensives to improve their supply lines and availability.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=1088–1089}}\nMontgomery and Bradley both pressed for priority delivery of supplies to their respective armies so they could continue their individual lines of advance and maintain pressure on the Germans. Eisenhower, however, preferred a broad-front strategy. He gave some priority to Montgomery's northern forces, which had the short-term goal of opening the urgently needed port of Antwerp and the long-term goal of capturing the [[Ruhr area]], the biggest industrial area of Germany.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=1088–1089}} With the Allies stalled, German Generalfeldmarschall [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] was able to reorganize the disrupted German armies into a coherent defence.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=1088–1089}}\n[[Field Marshal (UK)|Field Marshal]] Montgomery's [[Operation Market Garden]] only achieved some of its objectives, while its territorial gains left the Allied supply situation worse off than before. In October, the [[Canadian First Army]] fought the [[Battle of the Scheldt]], opening the port of Antwerp to shipping. As a result, by the end of October the supply situation had eased somewhat.\nDespite a lull along the front after the Scheldt battles, the German situation remained dire. While operations continued in the autumn, notably the [[Lorraine Campaign]], the [[Battle of Aachen]] and [[Battle of Hürtgen Forest|fighting in the Hürtgen Forest]], the strategic situation in the west had changed little. The Allies were [[Operation Queen|slowly pushing towards Germany]], but no decisive breakthrough was achieved. The Western Allies already had 96 divisions at or near the front, with an estimated ten more divisions en route from the United Kingdom. Additional Allied airborne units remained in England. The Germans could field a total of 55 understrength divisions.&lt;ref name=Cole1964&gt;{{citation |last=Cole |first=Hugh M. |authorlink=Hugh M.

On the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], the Soviets' [[Operation Bagration]] during the summer had destroyed much of Germany's [[Army Group Center]] (Heeresgruppe Mitte). The extremely swift operation ended only when the advancing [[Soviet Army|Red Army]] forces outran their supplies. By November, it was clear that Soviet forces were preparing for a winter offensive.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=1085}}\nMeanwhile, the Allied air offensive of early 1944 had effectively grounded the [[Luftwaffe]], leaving the German Army with little battlefield intelligence and no way to interdict Allied supplies. The converse was equally damaging; daytime movement of German forces was almost instantly noticed, and interdiction of supplies combined with the bombing of the [[Petrochemical industry in Romania|Romanian oil fields]] starved Germany of oil and gasoline.\nOne of the few advantages held by the German forces in November 1944 was that they were no longer defending all of Western Europe. Their front lines in the west had been considerably shortened by the Allied offensive and were much closer to the German heartland. This drastically reduced their supply problems despite Allied control of the air. Additionally, their extensive telephone and telegraph network meant that radios were no longer necessary for communications, which lessened the effectiveness of Allied [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]] intercepts. Nevertheless, some 40–50 messages per day were decrypted by Ultra. They recorded the quadrupling of German fighter forces and a term used in an intercepted Luftwaffe message—Jägeraufmarsch (literally &quot;Hunter Deployment&quot;)—implied preparation for an offensive operation. Ultra also picked up communiqués regarding extensive rail and road movements in the region, as well as orders that movements should be made on time.{{sfn|Parker|1994|pp=122–123}}\n===Drafting the offensive===\nThe German [[Führer]] [[Adolf Hitler]] felt that his mobile reserves allowed him to mount one major offensive. Although he realized nothing significant could be accomplished in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], he still believed an offensive against the Western Allies, whom he considered militarily inferior to the Red Army, would have some chances of success.{{sfn|Weinberg|1964}} Hitler believed he could split the Allied forces and compel the Americans and British to settle for a separate peace, independent of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=1091}} Success in the west would give the Germans time to design and produce more advanced weapons (such as [[jet aircraft]], new [[U-boat]] designs and [[super-heavy tank]]s) and permit the concentration of forces in the east. After the war ended, this assessment was generally viewed as unrealistic, given Allied air superiority throughout Europe and their ability to continually disrupt German offensive operations.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=1092}}\nGiven the reduced manpower of their land forces at the time, the Germans believed the best way to seize the initiative would be to attack in the West against the smaller Allied forces rather than against the vast Soviet armies. Even the [[encirclement]] and destruction of multiple Soviet armies like in 1941, would still have left the Soviets with a numerical superiority.\nSeveral senior German military officers, including Field Marshals [[Walter Model]] and [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], expressed concern as to whether the goals of the offensive could be realized. They offered alternative plans, but Hitler would not listen. The plan banked on unfavorable weather, including heavy fog and low-lying clouds, which would minimize the Allied air advantage.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=1090}} Hitler originally set the offensive for late November, before the anticipated start of the [[Vistula-Oder Offensive|Russian winter offensive]].\n[[File:82nd Grave.jpg|thumb|[[Paratrooper]]s of the [[82nd Airborne Division|U.S. 82nd Airborne Division]] dropping on Grave, during [[Operation Market Garden]], September 1944.]]\nIn the west supply problems began significantly to impede Allied operations, even though the opening of the port of Antwerp in late November improved the situation somewhat. The positions of the Allied armies stretched from southern France all the way north to the Netherlands. German planning for the counteroffensive rested on the premise that a successful strike against thinly-manned stretches of the line would halt Allied advances on the entire Western Front.\nModel and von Rundstedt both believed aiming for Antwerp was too ambitious, given Germany's scarce resources in late 1944. At the same time, they felt that maintaining a purely defensive posture (as had been the case since Normandy) would only delay defeat, not avert it. They thus developed alternative, less ambitious plans that did not aim to cross the [[Meuse River]] (in German and Dutch: Maas); Model's being [[Operation Herbstnebel (Northwest Europe)|Unternehmen Herbstnebel]] (Operation Autumn Mist) and von Rundstedt's [[Fall Martin]] (&quot;Plan Martin&quot;). The two field marshals combined their plans to present a joint &quot;small solution&quot; to Hitler.{{efn|The Ardennenoffensive was also named Rundstedt-Offensive, but von Rundstedt strongly objected &quot;to the fact that this stupid operation in the Ardennes is sometimes called the 'Rundstedt-Offensive'. This is a complete misnomer. I had nothing to do with it. It came to me as an order complete to the last detail. Hitler had even written on the plan in his own handwriting 'not to be altered'&quot;.

The disputes between Montgomery and Bradley were well known, and Hitler hoped he could exploit this disunity. If the attack were to succeed in capturing Antwerp, four complete armies would be trapped without supplies behind German lines. Both plans centered on attacks against the American forces.\nTasked with carrying out the operation were [[Generalfeldmarschall]] (Field Marshal) [[Walther Model]], the commander of German [[Army Group B]] (Heeresgruppe B), and Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], the overall commander of the German [[OB West|Army Command in the West]], who had moved his base of operations to [[Kransberg Castle]].\n===Operation names===\nThe [[Wehrmacht]]{{'}}s code name for the offensive was Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein (&quot;Operation Watch on the Rhine&quot;), after the German patriotic hymn ''[[Die Wacht am Rhein]],'' a name that deceptively implied the Germans would be adopting a defensive posture along the Western Front. The Germans also referred to it as &quot;Ardennenoffensive&quot; (Ardennes Offensive) and Rundstedt-Offensive, both names being generally used nowadays in modern Germany. The French (and Belgian) name for the operation is Bataille des Ardennes (Battle of the Ardennes).  The battle was militarily defined by the Allies as the Ardennes Counteroffensive, which included the German drive and the American effort to contain and later defeat it. The phrase Battle of the Bulge was coined by contemporary press to describe the way the Allied front line bulged inward on wartime news maps.{{sfn|Cirillo|2003|p=4}}{{sfn|Stanton|2006|p={{Page needed|date=November 2014}}}}\nWhile the Ardennes Counteroffensive is the correct term in Allied military language, the official Ardennes-Alsace campaign reached beyond the Ardennes battle region, and the most popular description in English speaking countries remains simply the Battle of the Bulge.\n===Planning===\n{{Main|Wehrmacht forces for the Ardennes Offensive}}\n{{See also|Battle of the Bulge order of battle}}\n{{Wikisource|The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge/Chapter II|Planning the Counteroffensive}}\n{{Wikisource|The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge/Chapter III|Troops and Terrain}}\n{{Wikisource|The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge/Chapter IV|Preparations}}\n[[File:German Wacht Am Rhein Offensive Plan.png|thumb|upright=1.8|The German plan]]\nThe OKW (High Command of the German Armed Forces) decided by mid-September, at Hitler's insistence, that the offensive would be mounted in the Ardennes, as was done [[Battle of France|in 1940]]. Many German generals objected, but the offensive was planned and carried out anyway. In 1940 German forces had passed through the Ardennes in three days before engaging the enemy, but the 1944 plan called for battle in the forest itself. The main forces were to advance westward to the Meuse River, then turn northwest for Antwerp and [[Brussels]]. The close terrain of the Ardennes would make rapid movement difficult, though open ground beyond the Meuse offered the prospect of a successful dash to the coast.\nFour armies were selected for the operation. First was the [[6th Panzer Army|Sixth Panzer Army]], under SS SS-Oberstgruppenführer [[Sepp Dietrich]]. It had been created on 26 October 1944 and incorporated the most senior and the experienced formation of the [[Waffen-SS]]: the [[Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler]] as well as the [[SS Division Hitlerjugend|12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend]]. The 6th Panzer Army was designated the northernmost attack force, having its northernmost point on the pre-attack battlefront nearest the German town of [[Monschau]]. It was entrusted with the offensive's primary objective—capturing [[Antwerp]].\nThe [[5th Panzer Army|Fifth Panzer Army]] under General [[Hasso von Manteuffel]] was assigned to the middle attack route with the objective of capturing Brussels.\nThe [[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|Seventh Army]], under General [[Erich Brandenberger]], was assigned to the southernmost attack, having its southernmost point on the pre-attack battlefront nearest the Luxembourgish city of [[Echternach]], with the task of protecting the flank. This Army was made up of only four infantry divisions, with no large-scale armored formations to use as a spearhead unit. As a result, they made little progress throughout the battle.\nAlso participating in a secondary role was the [[15th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fifteenth Army]], under General [[Gustav-Adolf von Zangen]]. Recently brought back up to strength and re-equipped after heavy fighting during [[Operation Market Garden|Market Garden]], it was located on the far north of the Ardennes battlefield and tasked with holding U.S. forces in place, with the possibility of launching its own attack given favorable conditions.\nFor the offensive to be successful, four criteria were deemed critical: the attack had to be a complete surprise; the weather conditions had to be poor to neutralize Allied [[air superiority]] and the damage it could inflict on the German offensive and its supply lines;{{sfn|Parker|1994|p=118}} the progress had to be rapid—the Meuse River, halfway to Antwerp, had to be reached by day 4; and Allied fuel supplies would have to be captured intact along the way because the combined Wehrmacht forces were short on fuel. The General Staff estimated they only had enough fuel to cover one-third to one-half of the ground to Antwerp in heavy combat conditions.\nThe plan originally called for just under 45 divisions, including a dozen [[panzer division|panzer]] and [[panzergrenadier]] divisions forming the [[armored spearhead]] and various infantry units to form a defensive line as the battle unfolded. By this time, however, the German Army suffered from an acute manpower shortage, and the force had been reduced to around 30 divisions. Although it retained most of its armor, there were not enough infantry units because of the defensive needs in the East. These 30 newly rebuilt [[division (military)|divisions]] used some of the last reserves of the German Army. Among them were [[Volksgrenadier]] (&quot;People's Grenadier&quot;) units formed from a mix of battle-hardened veterans and recruits formerly regarded as too young, too old or too frail to fight. Training time, equipment and supplies were inadequate during the preparations. German fuel supplies were precarious—those materials and supplies that could not be directly transported by rail had to be horse-drawn to conserve fuel, and the mechanized and panzer divisions would depend heavily on captured fuel. As a result, the start of the offensive was delayed from 27 November to 16 December.{{citation needed | date = August 2010}}\nBefore the offensive the Allies were virtually blind to German troop movement. During the liberation of France, the extensive network of the [[French resistance]] had provided valuable intelligence about German dispositions. Once they reached the German border, this source dried up. In France, orders had been relayed within the German army using radio messages enciphered by the [[Enigma machine]], and these could be picked up and decrypted by Allied code-breakers headquartered at [[Bletchley Park]], to give the intelligence known as Ultra. In Germany such orders were typically transmitted using telephone and [[teleprinter]], and a special [[radio silence]] order was imposed on all matters concerning the upcoming offensive.{{sfn|MacDonald|1984|p=40}} The major crackdown in the Wehrmacht after the [[20 July plot]] to assassinate Hitler resulted in much tighter security and fewer leaks. The foggy autumn weather also prevented Allied reconnaissance aircraft from correctly assessing the ground situation. German units assembling in the area were even issued charcoal instead of wood for cooking fires to cut down on smoke and reduce chances of Allied observers deducing a troop buildup was underway. {{sfn || Cole|1964|p=21}}\nFor these reasons Allied High Command considered the Ardennes a quiet sector, relying on assessments from their intelligence services that the Germans were unable to launch any major offensive operations this late in the war. What little intelligence they had led the Allies to believe precisely what the Germans wanted them to believe-–that preparations were being carried out only for defensive, not offensive, operations. The Allies relied too much on Ultra, not human reconnaissance. In fact, because of the Germans' efforts, the Allies were led to believe that a new defensive army was being formed around [[Düsseldorf]] in the northern Rhineland, possibly to defend against British attack. This was done by increasing the number of [[flak]] ('''Fl'''ug'''a'''bwehr'''k'''anonen, i.e. anti-aircraft cannons) in the area and the artificial multiplication of radio transmissions in the area. The Allies at this point thought the information was of no importance. All of this meant that the attack, when it came, completely surprised the Allied forces. Remarkably, the U.S. Third Army intelligence chief, Colonel [[Oscar Koch]], the U.S. First Army intelligence chief and the SHAEF intelligence officer Brigadier General [[Kenneth Strong]] all correctly predicted the German offensive capability and intention to strike the U.S. VIII Corps area. These predictions were largely dismissed by the U.S. 12th Army Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dougherty |first=Kevin |year=2002 |url=https://fas.org/irp/agency/army/mipb/2002_04.pdf |title=Oscar Koch: An Unsung Hero Behind Patton's Victories |journal=Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin April–June 2002 |pages=64–66 |volume=28 |issue=1 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong had informed [[Walter Bedell Smith|Bedell Smith]] in December of his suspicions.

O'Donnell writes that on 8 December 1944, U.S. Rangers at great cost took Hill 400 during the Battle of the Hürtgen Forest. The next day GIs who relieved the Rangers reported a considerable movement of German troops inside the Ardennes in the enemy's rear, but that no one in the chain of command connected the dots.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell Patrick K., ''Dog Company: The Boys of Pointe du Hoc—the Rangers Who Accomplished D-Day's Toughest Mission and Led the Way across Europe'', Da Capo Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;\nBecause the Ardennes was considered a quiet sector, economy-of-force considerations led it to be used as a training ground for new units and a rest area for units that had seen hard fighting. The U.S. units deployed in the Ardennes thus were a mixture of inexperienced troops (such as the raw U.S. [[99th Infantry Division (United States)|99th]] and [[106th Infantry Division (United States)|106th &quot;Golden Lions&quot; Divisions]]), and battle-hardened troops sent to that sector to recuperate (the [[U.S. 28th Infantry Division|28th Infantry Division]]).\nTwo major [[special operations]] were planned for the offensive. By October it was decided that [[Otto Skorzeny]], the German SS-commando who [[Gran Sasso raid|had rescued]] the former Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], was to lead a task force of English-speaking German soldiers in &quot;Operation Greif&quot;. These soldiers were to be dressed in American and British [[uniform]]s and wear [[dog tag (identifier)|dog tags]] taken from corpses and [[prisoner of war|POWs]]. Their job was to go behind American lines and change signposts, misdirect traffic, generally cause disruption and seize bridges across the Meuse River between [[Liège (city)|Liège]] and [[Namur (city)|Namur]]. By late November, another ambitious special operation was added: [[Col.]] [[Friedrich August von der Heydte]] was to lead a [[Fallschirmjäger (Nazi Germany)|Fallschirmjäger]]-[[Kampfgruppe]] (paratrooper combat group) in [[Operation Stösser]], a night-time paratroop drop behind the Allied lines aimed at capturing a vital road junction near [[Malmedy]].{{sfn || MacDonald|1984|pp=86–89}}{{sfn || Toland|1999|p=16,19}}\nGerman intelligence had set 20 December as the expected date for the start of the [[Vistula–Oder Offensive|upcoming Soviet offensive]], aimed at crushing what was left of German resistance on the Eastern Front and thereby opening the way to Berlin. It was hoped that Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] would delay the start of the operation once the German assault in the Ardennes had begun and wait for the outcome before continuing.\nAfter the [[20 July plot]] attempt on Hitler's life, and the close advance of the [[Red Army]] which would seize the site on 27 January 1945, Hitler and his staff had been forced to abandon the [[Wolfsschanze]] headquarters in [[East Prussia]], in which they had coordinated much of the fighting on the Eastern Front. After a brief visit to Berlin, Hitler travelled on his [[Führersonderzug]] (&quot;Special Train of the Führer&quot; (Leader)) to [[Giessen]] on 11 December, taking up residence in the [[Adlerhorst]] (eyrie) command complex, co-located with OB West's base at Kransberg Castle. Believing in omens and the successes of his early war campaigns that had been planned at Kransberg, Hitler had chosen the site from which he had overseen the successful 1940 campaign against France and the [[Low Countries]].\nVon Rundstedt set up his operational headquarters near [[Limburg an der Lahn|Limburg]], close enough for the generals and Panzer Corps commanders who were to lead the attack to visit Adlerhorst on 11 December, travelling there in an SS-operated bus convoy. With the castle acting as overflow accommodation, the main party was settled into the Adlerhorst's Haus 2 command bunker, including Gen. [[Alfred Jodl]], Gen. [[Wilhelm Keitel]], Gen. [[Günther Blumentritt|Blumentritt]], von Manteuffel and SS Gen. Joseph (&quot;Sepp&quot;) Dietrich. Von Rundstedt then ran through the battle plan, while Hitler made one of his endless speeches.\nIn a personal conversation on 13 December between [[Walther Model]] and [[Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte|Friedrich von der Heydte]], who was put in charge of [[Operation Stösser]], von der Heydte gave Operation Stösser less than a 10% chance of succeeding. Model told him it was necessary to make the attempt: &quot;It must be done because this offensive is the last chance to conclude the war favorably.&quot;{{sfn|Parker|2004|p=132}}\n==Initial German assault==\n[[File:Western Front Ardennes 1944.jpg|thumb|Situation on the Western Front as of 15 December 1944]]\nOn 16 December 1944, at 05:30, the Germans began the assault with a massive, 90-minute artillery barrage using 1,600 artillery pieces{{sfn|Quarrie|1999|p=}} across a {{convert|80|mi|adj=on|disp=flip}} front on the Allied troops facing the 6th Panzer Army. The Americans' initial impression was that this was the anticipated, localized counterattack resulting from the Allies' recent attack in the [[Battle of Elsenborn Ridge#Battle of Heartbreak Crossroads|Wahlerscheid]] sector to the north, where the 2nd Division had knocked a sizable dent in the [[Siegfried Line]]. Heavy snowstorms engulfed parts of the Ardennes area. While having the effect of keeping the Allied aircraft grounded, the weather also proved troublesome for the Germans because poor road conditions hampered their advance. Poor traffic control led to massive traffic jams and fuel shortages in forward units.\nIn the center, [[Hasso von Manteuffel|von Manteuffel]]'s [[5th Panzer Army|Fifth Panzer Army]] attacked towards [[Bastogne]] and [[St. Vith]], both road junctions of great strategic importance. In the south, [[Erich Brandenberger|Brandenberger]]'s [[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|Seventh Army]] pushed towards [[Luxembourg]] in its efforts to secure the flank from Allied attacks. Only one month before 250 members of the Waffen-SS had unsuccessfully tried to recapture the town of Vianden with its castle from the [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II|Luxembourgish resistance]] during the [[Battle of Vianden]].\n==Attack on the northern shoulder==\n{{Wikisource|The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge/Chapter V|The Sixth Panzer Army Attack}}\n{{Main|Battle of Elsenborn Ridge}}\nWhile the [[Siege of Bastogne]] is often credited as the central point where the German offensive was stopped,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explaining the silence surrounding Elsenborn Ridge battle|url=http://99div.com/direct/explaining_the_silence_surrounding_elsenborn_ridge_battle+1103elsenborn+4578706c61696e696e67207468652073696c656e636520737572726f756e64696e6720456c73656e626f726e20526964676520626174746c65|publisher=99th Infantry Division Association|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the battle for [[Battle of Elsenborn Ridge|Elsenborn Ridge]] was actually the decisive component of the Battle of the Bulge, stopping the advance of the best equipped armored units of the German army and forcing them to use unfavorable routes that considerably slowed their advance.{{sfn | MacDonald|1984|p=410}}{{sfn|Cole|1964|pp=1–64}}\n===Best German divisions assigned===\nThe attack on Monschau, Höfen, Krinkelt-Rocherath, and then Elsenborn Ridge was led by the units personally selected by [[Adolf Hitler]].

Kampfgruppe Peiper, at the head of the [[Waffen-SS|SS]] [[Oberstgruppenführer]] [[Josef Dietrich|Sepp Dietrich]]'s [[6th Panzer Army|Sixth Panzer Army]], had been designated to take the Losheim-Losheimergraben road, a key route through the [[Losheim Gap]], but it was closed by two collapsed overpasses that German engineers failed to repair during the first day.{{sfn || Cole|1964|p=83}} Peiper's forces were rerouted through Lanzerath, where on the first day, an entire German battalion of 500 men was held up for 10 hours at the small village of [[Battle of Lanzareth ridge|Lanzerath]].\nTo preserve the quantity of armor available, the infantry of the 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment, [[3rd Parachute Division (Germany)|3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division]], had been ordered to clear the village first. A single 18-man [[ISTAR|Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon]] from the [[99th Infantry Division (United States)#Most decorated platoon of World War II|99th Infantry Division]] along with four Forward Air Controllers held up the battalion of about 500 German paratroopers until sunset, about 16:00, causing 92 casualties among the Germans.\nThis created a bottleneck in the German advance.  Kampfgruppe Peiper did not begin his advance until nearly 16:00, more than 16 hours behind schedule and didn't reach Bucholz Station until the early morning of 17 December. Their intention was to control the twin villages of Rocherath-Krinkelt which would clear a path to the high ground of [[Battle of Elsenborn Ridge|Elsenborn Ridge]]. Occupation of this dominating terrain would allow control of the roads to the south and west and ensure supply to Kampfgruppe Peiper's armored task force.\n[[File:GERMAN TROOPS ADVANCING PAST ABANDONED AMERICAN EQUIPMENT.jpg|thumb|German troops advancing past abandoned American equipment]]\n===Malmedy massacre===\n{{Main|Malmedy massacre}}\n[[File:Malmedy Massacre.jpg|thumb|Scene of the [[Malmedy massacre]]]]\nAt 12:30 on 17 December, Kampfgruppe Peiper was near the hamlet of [[Baugnez]], on the height halfway between the town of [[Malmedy]] and Ligneuville, when they encountered elements of the [[285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion]], [[7th Armored Division (United States)|U.S. 7th Armored Division]].{{sfn|Cole|1964|pp=75–106}}{{sfn|MacDonald|1984|p={{Page needed|date=August 2010}}}} After a brief battle the lightly armed Americans surrendered.

About fifteen minutes after Peiper's advance guard passed through, the main body under the command of SS [[Sturmbannführer]] [[Werner Pötschke]] arrived. Allegedly, the SS troopers suddenly opened fire on the prisoners. As soon as the firing began, the prisoners panicked. Most were shot where they stood, though some managed to flee.

Peiper's forces was already behind his timetable because of the stiff American resistance and because when the Americans fell back, their engineers blew up bridges and emptied fuel dumps. Peiper's unit was delayed and his vehicles denied critically needed fuel.

Assessing his own situation, he determined that his Kampfgruppe did not have sufficient fuel to cross the bridge west of Stoumont and continue his advance. He maintained his lines west of Stoumont for a while, until the evening of 19 December when he withdrew them to the village edge. On the same evening the U.S. [[82nd Airborne Division]] under Maj. Gen. [[James M. Gavin|James Gavin]] arrived and deployed at La Gleize and along Peiper's planned route of advance.{{sfn|Bouwmeester|2004|p=109}}\nGerman efforts to reinforce Peiper were unsuccessful. Kampfgruppe Hansen was still struggling against bad road conditions and stiff American resistance on the southern route. Schnellgruppe Knittel was forced to disengage from the heights around Stavelot. Kampfgruppe Sandig, which had been ordered to take Stavelot, launched another attack without success. Sixth Panzer Army commander SS-Oberstgruppenführer [[Sepp Dietrich]] ordered [[Hermann Prieß]], commanding officer of the I SS Panzer Corps, to increase its efforts to back Peiper's Kampfgruppe, but Prieß was unable to break through.{{sfn|Bouwmeester|2004|p=111}}\n[[File:Stoumont JPG02.jpg|thumb|left|Froidcourt castle near Stoumont in 2011]]\nSmall units of the U.S. 2nd Battalion, 119th Infantry Regiment, 30th Infantry Division, attacked the dispersed units of Kampfgruppe Peiper on the morning of 21 December. They failed and were forced to withdraw, and a number were captured, including battalion commander Maj. Hal McCown.  Peiper learned that his reinforcements had been directed to gather in La Gleize to his east, and he withdrew, leaving wounded Americans and Germans in the {{Ill|fr|Froidcourt Castle|Château de Froidcourt}}. As he withdrew from Cheneux, American paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division engaged the Germans in fierce house-to-house fighting. The Americans shelled Kampfgruppe Peiper on 22 December, and although the Germans had run out of food and had virtually no fuel, they continued to fight. A Luftwaffe resupply mission went badly when SS-[[Brigadeführer]] (Brigadier Gen.) [[Wilhelm Mohnke]] insisted the grid coordinates supplied by Peiper were wrong, parachuting supplies into American hands in Stoumont.{{sfn|Bouwmeester|2004|p=112}}\nIn La Gleize, Peiper set up defenses waiting for German relief. When the relief force was unable to penetrate the Allied lines, he decided to break through the Allied lines and return to the German lines on 23 December. The men of the Kampfgruppe were forced to abandon their vehicles and heavy equipment, although most of the 800 remaining troops were able to escape.{{sfn|MacDonald|1984|p=461, 463}}\n===Outcome===\nThe 99th Infantry Division as a whole, outnumbered five to one, inflicted casualties in the ratio of eighteen to one.

Von der Heydte was given only eight days to prepare prior to the assault. He was not allowed to use his own regiment because their movement might alert the Allies to the impending counterattack. Instead, he was provided with a Kampfgruppe of 800 men. The [[2nd Parachute Corps (Germany)|II Parachute Corps]] was tasked with contributing 100 men from each of its regiments. In loyalty to their commander, 150 men from von der Heydte's own unit, the [[6th Parachute Division (Germany)|6th Parachute Regiment]], went against orders and joined him.{{sfn|Parker|2004|p=130}} They had little time to establish any [[unit cohesion]] or train together.\nThe parachute drop was a complete failure. Von der Heydte ended up with a total of around 300 troops. Too small and too weak to counter the Allies, they abandoned plans to take the crossroads and instead converted his mission to reconnaissance. With only enough ammunition for a single fight, they withdrew towards Germany and attacked the rear of the American lines. Only about 100 of his weary men finally reached the German rear.{{sfn|Parker|2004|p=137}}\n===Chenogne massacre===\n{{Main|Chenogne massacre}}\nFollowing the Malmedy massacre, on New Year's Day 1945, after having previously received orders to take no prisoners,{{sfn|Schrijvers|2005|p=303f}} American soldiers allegedly shot approximately sixty German prisoners of war near the Belgian village of Chenogne (8&amp;nbsp;km from Bastogne).{{sfn|Sorge|1986|p=147}}\n==Attack in the center==\n{{Wikisource|The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge/Chapter XVII|St. Vith is lost}}\n[[File:Battle of the Bulge 5th.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|[[Hasso von Manteuffel]] led Fifth Panzer Army in the middle attack route]]\nThe Germans fared better in the center (the {{convert|20|mi|abbr=on|disp=flip}} Schnee Eifel sector) as the Fifth Panzer Army attacked positions held by the U.S. [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th]] and [[106th Infantry Division (United States)|106th]] Infantry Divisions. The Germans lacked the overwhelming strength that had been deployed in the north, but still possessed a marked numerical and material superiority over the very thinly spread 28th and 106th divisions. They succeeded in surrounding two largely intact regiments (422nd and 423rd) of the 106th Division in a [[pincer movement]] and forced their surrender, a tribute to the way Manteuffel's new tactics had been applied.{{sfn|Liddell Hart|1970|p=653}} The official U.S. Army history states: &quot;At least seven thousand [men] were lost here and the figure probably is closer to eight or nine thousand.

These units, which operated under the command of Generals Robert W. Hasbrouck (7th Armored) and Alan W. Jones (106th Infantry), successfully resisted the German attacks, significantly slowing the German advance. At Montgomery's orders, St. Vith was evacuated on 21 December; U.S. troops fell back to entrenched positions in the area, presenting an imposing obstacle to a successful German advance. By 23 December, as the Germans shattered their flanks, the defenders' position became untenable and U.S. troops were ordered to retreat west of the [[Salm River]]. Since the German plan called for the capture of St. Vith by 18:00 on 17 December, the prolonged action in and around it dealt a major setback to their timetable.&lt;ref name=Cole1964/&gt;{{rp|407}}\n===Meuse River bridges===\n[[File:British Sherman Firefly Namur.jpg|thumb|British [[Sherman Firefly|Sherman &quot;Firefly&quot;]] tank in Namur on the Meuse River, December 1944]]\nTo protect the river crossings on the Meuse at Givet, Dinant and Namur, Montgomery ordered those few units available to hold the bridges on 19 December.

The Fifth Panzer Army was spearheaded by the 2nd Panzer Division while the Panzer-Lehrdivision (Armored Training Division) came up from the south, leaving Bastogne to other units. The [[Ourthe River]] was passed at Ourtheville on 21 December. Lack of fuel held up the advance for one day, but on 23 December the offensive was resumed towards the two small towns of [[Hargimont]] and [[Marche-en-Famenne]]. Hargimont was captured the same day, but Marche-en-Famenne was strongly defended by the American [[84th Division (United States)|84th Division]]. Gen. [[Heinrich Freiherr von Lüttwitz|von Lüttwitz]], commander of the [[XLVII Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXXVII Panzer-Korps]], ordered the Division to turn westwards towards Dinant and the Meuse, leaving only a blocking force at Marche-en-Famenne. Although advancing only in a narrow corridor, 2nd Panzer Division was still making rapid headway, leading to jubilation in Berlin. Headquarters now freed up the [[9th Panzer Division]] for Fifth Panzer Army, which was deployed at Marche.{{sfn|Zaloga|2004|pp=76–83}}\nOn 22/23 December German forces reached the woods of [[Foy-Nôtre-Dame]], only a few kilometers ahead of Dinant. However, the narrow corridor caused considerable difficulties, as constant flanking attacks threatened the division. On 24 December, German forces made their furthest penetration west. The Panzer-Lehrdivision took the town of [[Celles, Houyet|Celles]], while a bit farther north, parts of 2nd Panzer Division were in sight of the Meuse near Dinant at Foy-Nôtre-Dame. A hastily assembled Allied blocking force on the east side of the river, however, prevented the German probing forces from approaching the Dinant bridge. By late Christmas Eve the advance in this sector was stopped, as Allied forces threatened the narrow corridor held by the 2nd Panzer Division.{{sfn|Zaloga|2004|pp=76–83}}\n===Operation Greif and Operation Währung===\n{{Wikisource|The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge/Chapter XI|The 1st SS Panzer Division's Dash Westward, and Operation Greif}}\n{{Main|Operation Greif|Operation Währung}}\nFor Operation Greif (&quot;[[Griffin]]&quot;), Otto Skorzeny successfully infiltrated a small part of his battalion of English-speaking Germans disguised in American uniforms behind the Allied lines.

[[Military Police Corps (United States)|American MPs]] at these checkpoints grilled troops on things that every American was expected to know, like the identity of [[Mickey Mouse]]'s girlfriend, baseball scores, or the capital of a particular U.S. state—though many could not remember or did not know. General Omar Bradley was briefly detained when he correctly identified [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] as the capital of [[Illinois]] because the American MP who questioned him mistakenly believed the capital was Chicago.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=1092}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Decisive Battles: From Yorktown to Operation Desert Storm |author=Jonathon Riley |date=11 August 2010 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe tightened security nonetheless made things very hard for the German infiltrators, and a number of them were captured.

The more experienced 28th Infantry Division put up a much more dogged defense than the inexperienced soldiers of the 106th Infantry Division. The [[112th Infantry Regiment (United States)|112th Infantry Regiment]] (the most northerly of the 28th Division's regiments), holding a continuous front east of the Our, kept German troops from seizing and using the Our River bridges around [[Ouren]] for two days, before withdrawing progressively westwards.\n[[File:DeadBelgiumcivilians1944.jpg|left|thumb|Belgian civilians killed by German units during the offensive]]\nThe 109th and 110th Regiments of the 28th Division, however, fared worse, as they were spread so thinly that their positions were easily bypassed. Both offered stubborn resistance in the face of superior forces and threw the German schedule off by several days. The 110th's situation was by far the worst, as it was responsible for an {{convert|11|mi|adj=on|disp=flip}} front while its 2nd Battalion was withheld as the divisional reserve. Panzer columns took the outlying villages and widely separated strongpoints in bitter fighting, and advanced to points near Bastogne within four days. The struggle for the villages and American strongpoints, plus transport confusion on the German side, slowed the attack sufficiently to allow the [[101st Airborne Division]] (reinforced by elements from the [[9th Armored Division (United States)|9th]] and [[10th Armored Division (United States)|10th Armored Divisions]]) to reach Bastogne by truck on the morning of 19 December. The fierce defense of Bastogne, in which American paratroopers particularly distinguished themselves, made it impossible for the Germans to take the town with its important road junctions. The panzer columns swung past on either side, cutting off Bastogne on 20 December but failing to secure the vital crossroads.\nIn the extreme south, Brandenberger's three infantry divisions were checked by divisions of the [[U.S. VIII Corps]] after an advance of {{convert|4|mi|abbr=on|disp=flip}}; that front was then firmly held. Only the [[5th Parachute Division (Germany)|5th Parachute Division]] of Brandenberger's command was able to thrust forward {{convert|12|mi|abbr=on|disp=flip}} on the inner flank to partially fulfill its assigned role. Eisenhower and his principal commanders realized by 17 December that the fighting in the [[Ardennes]] was a major offensive and not a local counterattack, and they ordered vast reinforcements to the area. Within a week 250,000 troops had been sent. General Gavin of the [[82nd Airborne Division]] arrived on the scene first and ordered the 101st to hold Bastogne while the 82nd would take the more difficult task of facing the SS Panzer Divisions; it was also thrown into the battle north of the bulge, near Elsenborn Ridge.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n===Siege of Bastogne===\n{{Main|Siege of Bastogne}}\nBy the time the senior Allied commanders met in a bunker in [[Verdun-sur-Meuse|Verdun]] on 19 December, the town of Bastogne and its network of 11 hard-topped roads leading through the widely forested mountainous terrain with deep river valleys and boggy mud of the Ardennes region were to have been in German hands for several days. By the time of that meeting, two separate westbound German columns that were to have bypassed the town to the south and north, the [[2nd Panzer Division]] and [[Panzer-Lehr-Division]] of XLVII Panzer Corps, as well as the Corps' infantry ([[26th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|26th Volksgrenadier Division]]), coming due west had been engaged and much slowed and frustrated in outlying battles at defensive positions up to {{convert|10|mi|spell=in|disp=flip}} from the town proper—and were gradually being forced back onto and into the hasty defenses built within the municipality. Moreover, the sole corridor that was open (to the southeast) was threatened and it had been sporadically closed as the front shifted, and there was expectation that it would be completely closed sooner than later, given the strong likelihood that the town would soon be surrounded.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n[[File:German soldier Ardennes 1944.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|A German machine gunner marching through the Ardennes in December 1944.]]\nGen. Eisenhower, realizing that the Allies could destroy German forces much more easily when they were out in the open and on the offensive than if they were on the defensive, told his generals, &quot;The present situation is to be regarded as one of opportunity for us and not of disaster. There will be only cheerful faces at this table.&quot; Patton, realizing what Eisenhower implied, responded, &quot;Hell, let's have the guts to let the bastards go all the way to Paris. Then, we'll really cut 'em off and chew 'em up.&quot; Eisenhower, after saying he was not that optimistic, asked Patton how long it would take to turn his Third Army, located in northeastern France, north to counterattack. To the disbelief of the other generals present, Patton replied that he could attack with two divisions within 48 hours. Unknown to the other officers present, before he left Patton had ordered his staff to prepare three contingency plans for a northward turn in at least corps strength. By the time Eisenhower asked him how long it would take, the movement was already underway.{{sfn|Ambrose|1998|p=208}} On 20 December, Eisenhower removed the First and Ninth U.S. Armies from Gen.

The 26th VG received one Panzergrenadier Regiment from the [[15th Panzergrenadier Division]] on Christmas Eve for its main assault the next day. Because it lacked sufficient troops and those of the 26th VG Division were near exhaustion, the XLVII Panzerkorps concentrated its assault on several individual locations on the west side of the perimeter in sequence rather than launching one simultaneous attack on all sides. The assault, despite initial success by its tanks in penetrating the American line, was defeated and all the tanks destroyed. The next day, 26 December, the spearhead of Gen.

Units of the [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|British XXX Corps]] were holding the bridges at Dinant, Givet, and Namur and U.S. units were about to take over. The Germans had outrun their supply lines, and shortages of fuel and ammunition were becoming critical. Up to this point the German losses had been light, notably in armor, which was almost untouched with the exception of Peiper's losses. On the evening of 24 December, General [[Hasso von Manteuffel]] recommended to Hitler's Military Adjutant a halt to all offensive operations and a withdrawal back to the Westwall (literally ''Western Rampart''). Hitler rejected this.\nHowever, disagreement and confusion at the Allied command prevented a strong response, throwing away the opportunity for a decisive action. In the center, on Christmas Eve, the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]] attempted to attack and cut off the spearheads of the 2nd Panzer Division at the Meuse, while the units from the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry Group]] kept the 9th Panzer Division at Marche busy. As result, parts of the 2nd Panzer Division were cut off. The Panzer-Lehr division tried to relieve them, but was only partially successful, as the perimeter held. For the next two days the perimeter was strengthened. On 26 and 27 December the trapped units of 2nd Panzer Division made two break-out attempts, again only with partial success, as major quantities of equipment fell into Allied hands. Further Allied pressure out of Marche finally led the German command to the conclusion that no further offensive action towards the Meuse was possible.{{sfn|Zaloga|2004|pp=84–86}}\nIn the south, Patton's Third Army was battling to relieve Bastogne.

At 09:15, the Luftwaffe launched [[Unternehmen Bodenplatte]] (Operation Baseplate, literally Operation Floor Panel), a major campaign against Allied airfields in the [[Low Countries]], which are nowadays called the [[Benelux]] States. Hundreds of planes attacked Allied airfields, destroying or severely damaging some 465 aircraft. However, the Luftwaffe lost 277 planes, 62 to Allied fighters and 172 mostly because of an unexpectedly high number of Allied [[flak]] guns, set up to protect against German [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] [[flying bomb]]/missile attacks and using [[proximity fuse]]d shells, but also by [[friendly fire]] from the German flak guns that were uninformed of the pending large-scale German air operation. The Germans suffered heavy losses at an airfield named [[Asch Airfield|Y-29]], losing 24 of their own planes while downing only one American plane. While the Allies recovered from their losses in just days, the operation left the Luftwaffe weak and ineffective for the remainder of the war.{{sfn|Weinberg|1995|p=769}}\nOn the same day, German [[Army Group G]] (Heeresgruppe G) and [[Army Group Oberrhein (Germany)|Army Group Upper Rhine]] (Heeresgruppe Oberrhein) launched a major offensive against the thinly stretched, {{convert|70|mi|km|disp=flip}} line of the Seventh U.S. Army. This offensive, known as [[Operation Nordwind|Unternehmen Nordwind]] (Operation North Wind), was the last major German offensive of the war on the Western Front. The weakened Seventh Army had, at Eisenhower's orders, sent troops, equipment, and supplies north to reinforce the American armies in the Ardennes, and the offensive left it in dire straits.\nBy 15 January, Seventh Army's [[U.S. VI Corps|VI Corps]] was fighting on three sides in [[Alsace]]. With casualties mounting, and running short on replacements, tanks, ammunition, and supplies, Seventh Army was forced to withdraw to defensive positions on the south bank of the Moder River on 21 January. The German offensive drew to a close on 25 January. In the bitter, desperate fighting of Operation Nordwind, VI Corps, which had borne the brunt of the fighting, suffered a total of 14,716 casualties. The total for Seventh Army for January was 11,609.{{sfn|Cirillo|2003|p=53}} Total casualties included at least 9,000 wounded.{{sfn|Clarke|Smith|1993|p=527}} First, Third and Seventh Armies suffered a total of 17,000 hospitalized from the cold.{{sfn|Cirillo|2003|p=53}}{{efn|A footnote to the U.S. Army's official history volume &quot;Riviera to the Rhine&quot; makes the following note on U.S. Seventh Army casualties: &quot;As elsewhere, casualty figures are only rough estimates, and the figures presented are based on the postwar 'Seventh Army Operational Report, Alsace Campaign and Battle Participation, 1 June 1945' (copy CMH), which notes 11,609 Seventh Army battle casualties for the period, plus 2,836 cases of trench foot and 380 cases of frostbite, and estimates about 17,000 Germans killed or wounded with 5,985 processed prisoners of war. But the VI Corps AAR for January 1945 puts its total losses at 14,716 (773 killed, 4,838 wounded, 3,657 missing, and 5,448 nonbattle casualties); and Albert E. Cowdrey and Graham A. Cosmas, ''The Medical Department: The War Against Germany'', draft CMH MS (1988), pp. 54–55, a forthcoming volume in the United States Army in World War II series, reports Seventh Army hospitals processing about 9,000 wounded and 17,000 'sick and injured' during the period.

Patton's Third Army in the south, centered around Bastogne, would attack north, Montgomery's forces in the north would strike south, and the two forces planned to meet at [[Houffalize]].\nThe temperature during January 1945 was extremely low. Weapons had to be maintained and truck engines run every half-hour to prevent their oil from congealing. The offensive went forward regardless.\nEisenhower wanted Montgomery to go on the counter offensive on 1 January, with the aim of meeting up with Patton's advancing Third Army and cutting off most of the attacking Germans, trapping them in a pocket. However, Montgomery, refusing to risk underprepared infantry in a snowstorm for a strategically unimportant area, did not launch the attack until 3 January, by which time substantial numbers of German troops had already managed to fall back successfully, but at the cost of losing most of their heavy equipment.\nAt the start of the offensive, the First and Third U.S. Armies were separated by about {{convert|25|mi|abbr=on|disp=flip}}. American progress in the south was also restricted to about a kilometer a day. The majority of the German force executed a successful fighting withdrawal and escaped the battle area, although the fuel situation had become so dire that most of the German armor had to be abandoned. On 7 January 1945, Hitler agreed to withdraw all forces from the Ardennes, including the SS-Panzerdivisionen, thus ending all offensive operations. However, considerable fighting went on for another 3 weeks; St. Vith was recaptured by the Americans on 23 January, and the last German units participating in the offensive did not return to their start line until 25 January.\n[[Winston Churchill]], addressing the House of Commons following the Battle of the Bulge said, &quot;This is undoubtedly the greatest American battle of the war and will, I believe, be regarded as an ever-famous American victory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/botb/overview.html |title=Overview – Battle of the Bulge |publisher=United States Army |date=16 December 1944 |accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n==Strategy and leadership==\n===Hitler's chosen few===\nThe plan and timing for the Ardennes attack sprang purely from the mind of Adolf Hitler. He believed a critical fault line existed between the British and American military commands, and that a heavy blow on the Western Front would shatter this alliance. Planning for the &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; offensive emphasized secrecy and the commitment of overwhelming force. Due to the use of landline communications within Germany, motorized runners carrying orders, and draconian threats from Hitler, the timing and mass of the attack was not detected by [[Ultra|ULTRA]] codebreakers and achieved complete surprise. The allied leadership never saw it coming.{{sfn|MacDonald|1985|pp=77–79}}\nHitler had always resented the blue-blood Prussian leadership of the German army. So, when selecting leadership for the attack, he felt that the implementation of this decisive blow should be entrusted to his own Nazi party army, the Waffen-SS. Ever since German regular Army officers attempted to assassinate him, he had increasingly trusted only the SS and its heavily armed branch, the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|MacDonald|1985|pp=21–22}} After the invasion of Normandy, the SS armored units had suffered significant leadership casualties. These losses included SS-Gruppenführer (Major General) [[Kurt Meyer (soldier)|Kurt Meyer]], commander of the 12th SS Panzer (Armor) Division, captured by Belgian partisans on September 6, 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;mitcham&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Panzers in Winter, Hitler's Army and the Battle of the Bulge|last=Mitcham|first=Samuel W.|year=2006|publisher=Praeger Security International|isbn=0-275-97115-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} &lt;ref name=&quot;meyer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Grenadiers, The Story of Waffen-SS General Kurt &quot;Panzer&quot; Meyer|last=Meyer|first=Kurt|year=2005|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=978-0-8117-3197-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|308}} The tactical efficiency of these units were somewhat reduced. The strong right flank of the assault was therefore composed mostly of SS Divisions under the command of &quot;Sepp&quot; (Joseph) Dietrich, a fanatical political disciple of Hitler, and a loyal follower from the early days of the rise of [[National Socialism]] in Germany. The leadership composition of the Sixth Panzer Division had a distinctly political nature.{{sfn|Cole|1964|pp=1–64}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J28477, Ardennenoffensive, Lagebesprechnung.jpg|thumb|left|German field commanders plan the advance.]]None of the German field commanders entrusted with planning and executing the offensive believed it was possible to capture Antwerp. Even Sepp Dietrich, commanding the strongest arm of the attack, felt that the Ardennes was a poor area for armored warfare, and that the inexperienced and badly equipped Volksgrenadier units would clog the roads that the tanks would need for their rapid advance. In this Dietrich was proved correct. The horse drawn artillery and rocket units were a significant obstacle to the tanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;astor&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=A Blood Dimmed Tide, The Battle of the Bulge by the Men Who Fought It|last=Astor|first=Gerald|year=1992|publisher=Donald I.

Model and Manteuffel, the technical experts from the eastern front, took the view that a limited offensive with the goal of surrounding and crushing the American 1st Army would be the best the offensive could hope for. These revisions shared the same fate as Dietrich's objections. In the end, the headlong drive on Elsenborn Ridge would not benefit from support from German units that had already bypassed the ridge. The decision to stop the attacks on the twin villages and change the axis of the attacks southward to the hamlet of Domäne Bütgenbach, was also made by Dietrich.&lt;ref name=&quot;eisenhower&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisenhower|first=John S.D.|title=The Bitter Woods|edition=First|publisher=G.P.

However, the staff planning and organization of the attack was well done; most of the units committed to the offensive reached their jump off points undetected and were well organized and supplied for the attack.\n===Allied high-command controversy===\n[[File:Bernard Law Montgomery.jpg|thumb|upright|Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery]]]]\n[[File:Dwight D.

Also the British remembered a similar German armored counterattack at [[Kasserine Pass]] in North Africa, where the American army was routed by the German strike, once again confirming the British conservative view of strategy.&lt;ref name=&quot;atkinson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=An Army at Dawn, The War in North Africa, 1942–1943|last=Atkinson|first=Rick|year=2003|publisher=Henry Holt and Company, LLC| isbn=978-0-8050-8724-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|339}}\n===Montgomery's actions===\nThe abrasive British Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] was quick to widen this gap with characteristically inflammatory correspondence and public pronouncements, and a major break with the U.S. command seemed in the offing.

This change in command was ordered because the northern armies had not only lost all communications with Bradley, who was based in Luxembourg City,{{sfn|Urban|2005|p=194}} and the US command structure, but with adjacent units. Without radio or telephone communication Montgomery managed to improvise an effective command and control system based on those of the [[Duke of Wellington]]'s 'gallopers' of the [[Battle of Waterloo]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\nDescribing the situation as he found it on 20 December, Montgomery wrote;\n{{quote|The First Army was fighting desperately. Having given orders to [[Miles Dempsey|Dempsey]] and [[Harry Crerar|Crerar]], who arrived for a conference at 11&amp;nbsp;am, I left at noon for the H.Q. of the First Army, where I had instructed Simpson to meet me. I found the northern flank of the bulge was very disorganized. Ninth Army had two corps and three divisions; First Army had three corps and fifteen divisions. Neither Army Commander had seen Bradley or any senior member of his staff since the battle began, and they had no directive on which to work. The first thing to do was to see the battle on the northern flank ''as one whole'', to ensure the vital areas were held securely, and to create reserves for counter-attack. I embarked on these measures: I put British troops under command of the Ninth Army to fight alongside American soldiers, and made that Army take over some of the First Army Front. I positioned British troops as reserves behind the First and Ninth Armies until such time as American reserves could be created. Slowly but surely the situation was held, and then finally restored. Similar action was taken on the southern flank of the bulge by Bradley, with the Third Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;}}\nDue to the news blackout imposed on the 16th, the change of leadership to Montgomery did not become known to the outside world until eventually SHAEF made a public announcement making clear that the change in command was &quot;absolutely nothing to do with failure on the part of the three American generals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Charles |last1=Whiting |pages= 312|title= Battle Of Hurtgen Forest | publisher =Da Capo Press |date=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|198}} This resulted in headlines in British newspapers. The story was also covered in ''Stars and Stripes'' and for the first time British contribution to the fighting was mentioned.\nMontgomery asked Churchill if he could give a conference to the press to explain the situation. Though some of his staff were concerned at the image it would give, the conference had been cleared by [[Lord Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]], the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]], who was possibly the only person to whom Monty would listen.\nOn the same day as Hitler's withdrawal order, 7 January, Montgomery held his press conference at Zonhoven.{{sfn|Gallagher|1945}} Montgomery started with giving credit to the &quot;courage and good fighting quality&quot; of the American troops, characterizing a typical American as a &quot;very brave fighting man who has that tenacity in battle which makes a great soldier&quot;, and went on to talk about the necessity of Allied teamwork, and praised Eisenhower, stating, &quot;Teamwork wins battles and battle victories win wars. On our team, the captain is General Ike.&quot;\nThen Montgomery described the course of the battle for a half-hour. Coming to the end of his speech he said he had &quot;employed the whole available power of the British Group of Armies; this power was brought into play very gradually&amp;nbsp;... Finally it was put into battle with a bang&amp;nbsp;... you thus have the picture of British troops fighting on both sides of the Americans who have suffered a hard blow.&quot; He stated that he (i.e., the German) was &quot;headed off&amp;nbsp;... seen off&amp;nbsp;... and&amp;nbsp;... written off&quot;. &quot;The battle has been the most interesting, I think possibly one of the most interesting and tricky battles I have ever handled.&quot;.{{sfn|Bradley|1951|p=58}}{{sfn|Ryan|1995|pp=204–205}}&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;''The Memoirs of Field-Marshall Montgomery'' – 1958, p. 311–314&lt;/ref&gt;\nDespite his positive remarks about American soldiers, the overall impression given by Montgomery, at least in the ears of the American military leadership, was that he had taken the lion's share of credit for the success of the campaign, and had been responsible for rescuing the besieged Americans.&lt;ref name=thisday&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/monty-holds-a-press-conference |title=This Day in History: Monty holds a press conference |publisher=History.com |accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;\nHis comments were interpreted as self-promoting, particularly his claiming that when the situation &quot;began to deteriorate,&quot; Eisenhower had placed him in command in the north. Patton and Eisenhower both felt this was a misrepresentation of the relative share of the fighting played by the British and Americans in the Ardennes (for every British soldier there were thirty to forty Americans in the fight), and that it belittled the part played by Bradley, Patton and other American commanders. In the context of Patton's and Montgomery's well-known antipathy, Montgomery's failure to mention the contribution of any American general beside Eisenhower was seen as insulting. Indeed, General Bradley and his American commanders were already starting their counterattack by the time Montgomery was given command of 1st and 9th U.S. Armies.{{sfn|Bradley|1983|pp=382–385}} Focusing exclusively on his own generalship, Montgomery continued to say he thought the counteroffensive had gone very well but did not explain the reason for his delayed attack on 3 January. He later attributed this to needing more time for preparation on the northern front. According to Winston Churchill, the attack from the south under Patton was steady but slow and involved heavy losses, and Montgomery was trying to avoid this situation.\nMany American officers had already grown to dislike Montgomery, who was seen by them as an overly cautious commander, arrogant, and all too willing to say uncharitable things about the Americans. The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill found it necessary in a speech to Parliament to explicitly state that the Battle of the Bulge was purely an American victory.\nMontgomery subsequently recognized his error and later wrote: &quot;Not only was it probably a mistake to have held this conference at all in the sensitive state of feeling at the time, but what I said was skilfully distorted by the enemy. [[Chester Wilmot]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Struggle for Europe'', p. 611&lt;/ref&gt; explained that his dispatch to the [[BBC]] about it was intercepted by the German wireless, re-written to give it an anti-American bias, and then broadcast by Arnhem Radio, which was then in [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]]' hands. Monitored at [[Omar Bradley|Bradley]]'s H.Q., this broadcast was mistaken for a B.B.C. transmission and it was this twisted text that started the uproar.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt;\nMontgomery later said, &quot;Distorted or not, I think now that I should never have held that press conference. So great were the feelings against me on the part of the American generals that whatever I said was bound to be wrong. I should therefore have said nothing.&quot; Eisenhower commented in his own memoirs: &quot;I doubt if Montgomery ever came to realize how resentful some American commanders were. They believed he had belittled them—and they were not slow to voice reciprocal scorn and contempt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, Brian, ''A Field Marshal in the Family'', Pen and Sword, 2010, p.296.&lt;/ref&gt;\nBradley and Patton both threatened to resign unless Montgomery's command was changed. Eisenhower, encouraged by his British deputy [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|Arthur Tedder]], had decided to sack Montgomery. However, intervention by Montgomery's and Eisenhower's [[Chief of Staff|Chiefs of Staff]], Maj. Gen. [[Freddie de Guingand]], and Lt. Gen. [[Walter Bedell Smith]], moved Eisenhower to reconsider and allowed Montgomery to apologize.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\nThe German commander of the [[5th Panzer Army]], [[Hasso von Manteuffel]] said of Montgomery's leadership:\n{{quote |The operations of the American 1st Army had developed into a series of individual holding actions. Montgomery's contribution to restoring the situation was that he turned a series of isolated actions into a coherent battle fought according to a clear and definite plan.

The southern units held the line in their region but were not involved in the battle except for elements they sent north as reinforcements.\n==In entertainment==\nThe battle has been depicted in numerous works of fiction and entertainment, including the films ''[[Battleground (film)|Battleground]]'' (1949) and ''[[Battle of the Bulge (film)|Battle of the Bulge]]'' (1965). During 1992, the battle was immortalized in the movie ''[[A Midnight Clear]]''. [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that &quot;The opening shots of &quot;A Midnight Clear&quot; have a clarity and force that linger, casting a spell over the entire movie. They show a group of young men in Jeeps, making their way through the deep snow in an almost primeval forest. Everything is dark or blinding white; the snow crunches, reluctantly accepting the trespassers. We can see at once that this is a war movie - we know from the costumes it is World War II - but somehow the film is able to suggest some hidden purpose, and we know it will not simply tell a war story.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-midnight-clear-1992&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn [[video games]] alone, it has received about thirty treatments as of 2014, mostly in [[strategy games]], beginning with ''[[Tigers in the Snow]]'' (1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=Tim|title=The Flare Path: Bulges|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/12/26/the-flare-path-battle-of-the-bulge-wargames/|accessdate=26 December 2014|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 70 board wargames have been created about it, the earliest in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/25084/world-war-2-battle-bulge Boardgamegeek]&lt;/ref&gt;\n==See also==\n* [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II]]\n* [[Operation Spring Awakening]]\n* [[82nd armored reconnaissance battalion]]\n* [[17th Armored Engineer Battalion]]\n==Notes==\n{{notes|30em}}\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=60em}}\n* {{citation |last=Ambrose |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Ambrose |title=Band of Brothers |publisher=New York: Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1992 |isbn=0-671-76922-7}}\n* {{citation |last=Ambrose |first=Stephen |title=Citizen Soldiers |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1998 |isbn=0-684-84801-5}}\n* {{citation |last=Bergström |first=Christer |title=The Ardennes: Hitler's Winter Offensive 1944–1945 |publisher=Casemate Publishers |location=Havertown |year=2014|isbn=978-1-61200-277-4}}\n* {{citation |last=Blumenson |first=Martin |title=Eisenhower |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |year=1972}}\n* {{citation|last=Bouwmeester |first=Maj.
