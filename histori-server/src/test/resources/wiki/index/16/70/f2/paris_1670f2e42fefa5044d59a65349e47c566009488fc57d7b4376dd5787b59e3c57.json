By the 12th century, Paris was the largest city in the western world, a prosperous trading centre, and the home of the [[University of Paris]], one of the first in Europe. In the 18th century, it was the centre stage for the [[French Revolution]], and became an important centre of finance, commerce, fashion, science, and the arts, a position it still retains today.\nThe Paris Region had a [[GDP]] of €624 billion (US $687 billion) in 2012, accounting for 30.0 percent of the GDP of France, and ranking it as one of the five wealthiest regions in Europe; it is the banking and financial centre of France, and contains the headquarters of 29 of the 31 French companies ranked in the 2015 [[Fortune Global 500]].\nParis is the home of the most visited [[art museum]] in the world, the [[Louvre]], as well as the [[Musée d'Orsay]], noted for its collection of French [[Impressionist]] art, and the [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], a museum of modern and contemporary art. The notable architectural landmarks of Paris include [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] (12th century); the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] (13th century); the [[Eiffel Tower]] (1889); and the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Basilica of Sacré-Cœur]] on [[Montmartre]] (1914). In 2014 Paris received 22.4 million visitors, making it one of the world's top tourist destinations.&lt;ref&gt;As a major crossroads of civilization, Paris has been represented 22 times in World's Fairs and Expositions since 1798&lt;/ref&gt; Paris is also known for its fashion, particularly the twice-yearly [[Paris Fashion Week]], and for its ''[[haute cuisine]]'', and [[Michelin stars|three-star]] restaurants. Most of France's major universities and ''[[grandes écoles]]'' are located in Paris, as are France's major newspapers, including ''[[Le Monde]]'', ''[[Le Figaro]]'', and ''[[Libération]]''.\nParis is home to the [[association football]] club [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] and the [[rugby union]] club [[Stade Français]]. The 80,000-seat [[Stade de France]], built for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], is located just north of Paris in the commune of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]]. Paris hosts the annual [[French Open]] [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] [[tennis]] tournament on the red clay of [[Stade Roland Garros|Roland Garros]]. Paris played host to the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]] and [[1924 Summer Olympics]], the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]] and [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]s, and the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]].\nThe city is a major rail, highway, and air-transport hub, served by the two international airports [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris-Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Paris-Orly Airport|Paris-Orly]]. Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the [[Paris Métro]], serves 4.5 million passengers daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Busiest Subways|url = http://geography.about.com/od/urbaneconomicgeography/a/Busiest-Subways.htm|website = About.com (education)|accessdate = 30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paris is the hub of the [[Autoroutes of France|national road network]], and is surrounded by three orbital roads: the [[Périphérique (Paris)|Périphérique]], the [[A86 autoroute|A86]] motorway, and the [[Francilienne]] motorway in the outer suburbs.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Paris|Timeline of Paris}}\n===Etymology===\n{{hatnote|See [[wikt:Paris#Translations|Wiktionary]] for the name of Paris in various languages other than English and French.}}\n[[File:Charles Marville, Place de l'Opéra, 1878.jpg|thumb|In the 1860s Paris streets and monuments were illuminated by 56,000 gas lamps, giving it the name &quot;The City of Light.&quot;|312x312px]]\nThe name &quot;Paris&quot; is derived from its early inhabitants, the Celtic [[Parisii (France)|Parisii]] tribe.{{Sfn|Margerison|2011|p=167}}\nParis is often referred to as &quot;The City of Light&quot; (''La Ville Lumière''),{{sfn|Robertson|2010|p=37}} both because of its leading role during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and more literally because Paris was one of the first European cities to adopt gas [[street light]]ing. In the 1860s, the boulevards and streets of Paris were illuminated by 56,000 gas lamps.{{sfn|Du Camp|1875|p=596}} Since the late 19th century, Paris is also known as ''Panam(e)'' ({{IPA-fr|panam|pron}}) in [[argot|French slang]].{{sfn|Leclanche|1998|p=55}}\nInhabitants are known in English as &quot;Parisians&quot; and in French as ''Parisiens'' ({{IPA-fr|paʁizjɛ̃||Parisien2.ogg}}), pejoratively also called ''Parigots'' ({{IPA-fr|paʁiɡo||Parigot.ogg}}).&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The word was most likely created by Parisians of the lower popular class who spoke *argot*, then *parigot* was used in a provocative manner outside the Parisian region and throughout France to mean Parisians in general.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dottin|1920|p=535}}\n===Origins===\nThe ''[[Parisii (Gaul)|Parisii]]'', a sub-tribe of the [[Celt]]ic [[Senones]], inhabited the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC.{{sfn|Arbois de Jubainville|Dottin|1889|p=132}}{{sfn|Cunliffe|2004|p=201}} One of the area's major north-south trade routes crossed the Seine on the [[île de la Cité]]; this meeting place of land and water trade routes gradually became a town and an important trading centre.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=25}} The Parisii traded with many river towns as far away as the Iberian Peninsula, and minted their own coins for that purpose.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009| pp=65-70}}\n[[File:ParisiiCoins.jpg|thumb|left|Gold coins minted by the Parisii (1st century BC)]]\nThe [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered the [[Paris Basin (geology)|Paris basin]] in 52 BC and,{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=88-104}} after making the island a garrison camp, began extending their settlement in a more permanent way to Paris' [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]]. The [[Gallo-Roman]] town was originally called [[Lutetia]] (more fully, ''Lutetia Parisiorum'', &quot;Lutetia of the Parisii&quot;). It became a prosperous city with a forum, baths, temples, theatres, and an [[amphitheatre]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=154-167}}\nBy the end of the Western Roman Empire, the town was known simply as ''Parisius'' in Latin and ''Paris'' in French.{{Sfn|Meunier|2014|p=12}} [[Christianity]] was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD. According to tradition, it was brought by Saint [[Denis]], the first Bishop of Paris. When he refused to renounce his faith, he was beheaded on the hill which became known as the &quot;Mountain of Martyrs&quot; (''Mons Martyrum''), eventually &quot;[[Montmartre]]&quot;. His burial place became an important religious shrine; the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] was built there and became the burial place of the French Kings.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=210-11}}\n[[Clovis I|Clovis the Frank]], the first king of the [[Merovingian dynasty]], made the city his capital from 508. A gradual immigration by the [[Franks]] also occurred in Paris in the beginning of the Frankish domination of Gaul which created the Parisian [[Francien]] dialects.\nFortification of the Île-de-France failed to prevent [[Siege of Paris (845)|sacking by Vikings in 845]] but Paris' strategic importance—with its bridges preventing ships from passing—was established by successful defence in the [[Siege of Paris (885–86)]]. In 987 [[Hugh Capet]], [[Count of Paris]] (''comte de Paris''), [[Duke of the Franks]] (''duc des Francs'') was elected [[List of French monarchs|King of the Franks]] (''roi des Franks''). Under the rule of the [[House of Capet|Capetian]] kings, Paris gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in France.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=210-11}}\n===Middle Ages to Louis XIV===\n{{see also|Paris in the Middle Ages|Paris in the 16th century|Paris in the 17th century}}\n[[File:Palais de la Cite.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palais de la Cité]] and [[Sainte-Chapelle]], viewed from the Left Bank, from the ''[[Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]'' (month of June) (1410)|225x225px]]\nBy the end of the 12th century, Paris had become the political, economic, religious, and cultural capital of France.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=27}} The ''Île de la Cité'' was the site of the royal palace. In 1163, during the reign of [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], [[Maurice de Sully]], bishop of Paris, undertook the construction of the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] at its eastern extremity. The [[Left Bank]] was the site of the [[University of Paris]], a corporation of students and teachers formed in the mid-12th century to train scholars first in theology, and later in canon law, medicine and the arts.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|pp=28-9}}{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=27}} The [[Right Bank]] became the centre of commerce and finance. The merchants who controlled the trade on the river formed a league and quickly became a powerful force. Between 1190 and 1202, [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] built the massive fortress of the [[Louvre]], continued the construction of Notre Dame, rebuilt the two bridges, began paving Paris' main thoroughfares, and the construction of a fortified wall around the city.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|pp=36-40}}\nDuring the [[Hundred Years' War]], the army of the Duke of Burgundy and a force of about two hundred English soldiers occupied Paris from May 1420 until 1436. They repelled an attempt by [[Joan of Arc]] to liberate the city in 1429.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|Pages=52-53}} A century later, during the [[French Wars of Religion]], Paris was a stronghold of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]].

The city had been neglected for decades; by the time of his assassination in 1610, Henry IV had rebuilt the ''[[Pont Neuf]]'', the first Paris bridge with sidewalks and not lined with buildings, linked with a new wing the Louvre to the [[Tuileries Palace]], and created the first Paris residential square, the ''Place Royale'', now [[Place des Vosges]].{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=577}}\nIn the 17th century, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], chief minister of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], was determined to make Paris the most beautiful city in Europe. He built five new bridges, a new chapel for the [[College of Sorbonne]], and a palace for himself, the ''Palais Cardinal'', which he bequeathed to Louis XIII, and which became, after his own death in 1642, the [[Palais-Royal]].{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=582}}\n[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] distrusted the Parisians and moved his court to [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in 1682, but his reign also saw an unprecedented flourishing of the arts and sciences in Paris. The [[Comédie-Française]], the Academy of Painting, and the [[French Academy of Sciences]] were founded and made their headquarters in the city. To show that the city was safe against attack, he had the [[City walls of Paris|city walls]] demolished, replacing them with ''[[Boulevards of Paris#The grands boulevards|Grands Boulevards]]''.{{Sfn|Combeau|2003|pp=42-3}} To leave monuments to his reign, he built the ''[[Collège des Quatre-Nations]]'', ''[[Place Vendôme]]'', ''[[Place des Victoires]]'', and began ''[[Les Invalides]]''.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pp=590-591}}\n===The 18th and 19th century===\n{{see also|Paris in the 18th century|Paris during the Second Empire|Haussmann's renovation of Paris}}\n[[File:Lallemand - Arrestation du gouverneur de la Bastille - 1790.jpg|thumb|right|The storming of the [[Bastille]] on 14 July 1789 marked the beginning of the French Revolution.|225x225px]]\nBetween 1640 and 1789, Paris grew in population from 400,000 to 600,000. A new boulevard, the [[Champs-Élysées]], extended the city west to ''[[Place Charles de Gaulle|Étoile]]'',{{Sfn|Combeau|2003|pp=45-7}} while the working-class neighbourhood of the [[Faubourg Saint-Antoine]] on the eastern site of the city grew more and more crowded with poor [[Migrant worker|migrants]] from other regions of France.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|pp=129-133}}\nParis was the centre of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity known as the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] published their ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' in 1751-52, and the [[Montgolfier Brothers]] launched the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 November 1783, from the gardens of the [[Château de la Muette]]. Paris was the financial capital of continental Europe, the primary European centre of book publishing, fashion, and the manufacture of fine furniture and luxury goods.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|p=120}}\nIn the summer of 1789, Paris became the centre stage of the [[French Revolution]]. On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the [[Invalides]], acquiring thousands of guns, and [[storming of the Bastille|stormed the Bastille]], a symbol of royal authority. The first independent [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]], or city council, met in the ''Hôtel de Ville'' and, on 15 July, elected a [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]], the astronomer [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]].{{sfn|Paine|1998|p=453}}\nLouis XVI and the royal family [[Women's march on Versailles|were brought to Paris]] and made virtual prisoners within the Tuileries Palace.

Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; &quot;bistro&quot; means &quot;quickly&quot; in [[Russian language|Russian]], and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=715}} A '''brasserie''' originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer.
