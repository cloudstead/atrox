Aircraft losses from Lundstrom, ''Guadalcanal Campaign'', p.&amp;nbsp;522.&lt;/ref&gt;\n| campaignbox =\n{{Campaignbox Guadalcanal}}\n{{Campaignbox Solomons}}\n}}\nThe '''Naval Battle of Guadalcanal''', sometimes referred to as the '''Third and Fourth Battles of Savo Island''', the '''Battle of the Solomons''', the '''Battle of Friday the 13th''', or, in Japanese sources, the {{Nihongo|'''Third Battle of the Solomon Sea'''|第三次ソロモン海戦|Dai-san-ji Soromon Kaisen}}, took place from 12–15 November 1942, and was the decisive engagement in a series of [[naval battle]]s between [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] (primarily United States) and [[Military of Japan|Imperial Japanese forces]] during the months-long [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] in the [[Solomon Islands]] during World War II. The action consisted of combined air and sea engagements over four days, most near [[Guadalcanal]] and all related to a Japanese effort to reinforce land forces on the island. The only two U.S. Navy admirals to be killed in a surface engagement in the war were lost in this battle.\nAllied forces, primarily from the U.S., had landed on Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942 and seized an airfield, later called [[Honiara International Airport|Henderson Field]], that was under construction by the Japanese military. There were several subsequent attempts by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]], using reinforcements delivered to Guadalcanal by ship, to recapture the airfield, which ultimately failed. In early November 1942, the Japanese organized a transport convoy to take 7,000 infantry troops and their equipment to Guadalcanal to attempt once again to retake the airfield. Several Japanese warship forces were assigned to bombard Henderson Field with the goal of destroying Allied aircraft that posed a threat to the convoy. Learning of the Japanese reinforcement effort, U.S. forces launched aircraft and warship attacks to defend Henderson Field and prevent the Japanese ground troops from reaching Guadalcanal.\nIn the resulting battle, both sides lost numerous warships in two extremely destructive surface engagements at night. Nevertheless, the U.S. succeeded in turning back attempts by the Japanese to bombard Henderson Field with battleships. Allied aircraft also sank most of the Japanese troop transports and prevented the majority of the Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal. Thus, the battle turned back Japan's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby [[Tulagi]], resulting in a [[strategic victory]] for the U.S. and its allies and deciding the ultimate outcome of the Guadalcanal campaign in their favor.\n==Background==\nThe six-month [[Guadalcanal campaign]] began on 7 August 1942, when Allied (primarily U.S.) forces landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the [[Florida Islands]] in the [[Solomon Islands]], a pre-war colonial possession of Great Britain. The landings were meant to prevent the Japanese using the islands as bases from which to threaten the [[materiel|supply]] routes between the U.S. and Australia, and to secure them as starting points for a campaign to neutralize the major [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] military base at [[Rabaul]] and support of the Allied [[New Guinea campaign]]. The Japanese had [[Invasion of Tulagi (May 1942)|occupied Tulagi]] in May 1942 and began constructing an airfield on Guadalcanal in June 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Hogue, ''Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;235–236.&lt;/ref&gt;\nBy nightfall on 8 August, the 11,000 Allied troops [[Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo|secured Tulagi]], the nearby small islands, and a Japanese airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal (later renamed Henderson Field). Allied aircraft operating out of Henderson were called the &quot;[[Cactus Air Force]]&quot; (CAF) after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal. To protect the airfield, the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point. Additional reinforcements over the next two months increased the number of U.S. troops at Lunga Point to more than 20,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;14–15; Miller, ''Guadalcanal:  The First Offensive'', p.&amp;nbsp;143; Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;338; and Shaw, ''First Offensive'', p.&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn response, the Japanese [[Imperial General Headquarters]] assigned the Imperial Japanese Army's 17th&amp;nbsp;Army, a [[corps]]-sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant-General [[Harukichi Hyakutake]], with the task of retaking Guadalcanal. Units of the 17th&amp;nbsp;Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal on 19 August, to drive Allied forces from the island.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;96–99; Dull, ''Imperial Japanese Navy'', p.&amp;nbsp;225; Miller, ''Guadalcanal:  The First Offensive'', pp.&amp;nbsp;137–138.&lt;/ref&gt;\nBecause of the threat by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field, the Japanese were unable to use large, slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island. Instead, they used warships based at Rabaul and the [[Shortland Islands]]. The Japanese warships—mainly light cruisers or destroyers from the [[IJN 8th Fleet|Eighth Fleet]] under the command of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Gunichi Mikawa]]—were usually able to make the round trip down &quot;[[The Slot]]&quot; to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to air attack. Delivering the troops in this manner, however, prevented most of the soldiers' heavy equipment and supplies—such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition—from being carried to Guadalcanal with them. These high-speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and came to be known as the &quot;[[Tokyo Express]]&quot; by Allied forces and &quot;Rat Transportation&quot; by the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;202, 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:HendersonField.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, late August 1942. The view looks northwest with the [[Lunga River (Solomon Islands)|Lunga River]] and [[Lunga Point]] at the top of the image.]]\nThe first Japanese attempt to recapture Henderson Field failed when a 917-man force was defeated on 21 August in the [[Battle of the Tenaru]]. The next attempt took place from 12–14 September, ending in the defeat of the [[Kawaguchi Detachment|6,000 men]] under the command of Major General [[Kiyotake Kawaguchi]] at the [[Battle of Edson's Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;141–143, 156–158, 228–246, &amp;&amp;nbsp;681.&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn October, the Japanese again tried to recapture Henderson Field by delivering 15,000 more men—mainly from the [[Japanese Imperial Army|Army's]] [[2nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|2nd Infantry Division]]—to Guadalcanal. In addition to delivering the troops and their equipment by Tokyo Express runs, the Japanese also successfully pushed through one large convoy of slower transport ships. Enabling the approach of the transport convoy was a nighttime bombardment of Henderson Field by two battleships on 14 October that heavily damaged the airfield's runways, destroyed half of the CAF's aircraft, and burned most of the available aviation fuel. In spite of the damage, Henderson personnel were able to restore the two runways to service and replacement aircraft and fuel were delivered, gradually restoring the CAF to its pre-bombardment level over the next few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;315–3216; Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;171–175; Hough, ''Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;327–328.&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe next Imperial attempt to retake the island with the newly arrived troops occurred from 20–26 October and was defeated with heavy losses in the [[Battle for Henderson Field]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', 337–367.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] (the commander of the Japanese [[Combined Fleet]]) defeated U.S. naval forces in the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]], driving them away from the area. The Japanese carriers, however, were also forced to retreat because of losses to carrier aircraft and aircrews.&lt;ref&gt;Hara, ''Japanese Destroyer Captain'', 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Yamamoto's ships returned to their main bases at [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in Micronesia, where he had his headquarters, and Rabaul while three carriers returned to Japan for repairs and refitting.&lt;ref&gt;Hammel, ''Guadalcanal:  Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:Map of Solomons area in 1942.png|thumb|350px|right|The Solomon Islands. &quot;The Slot&quot; ([[New Georgia Sound]]) runs down the center of the islands, from Bougainville and the Shortlands (center) to Guadalcanal (lower right).]]\nThe Japanese Army planned another attack on Guadalcanal in November 1942, but further reinforcements were needed before the operation could proceed. The Army requested assistance from Yamamoto to deliver the needed reinforcements to the island and to support their planned offensive on the Allied forces guarding Henderson Field. To support the reinforcement effort, Yamamoto provided 11&amp;nbsp;large transport ships to carry 7,000&amp;nbsp;army troops from the [[38th Infantry Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|38th Infantry Division]], their [[ammunition]], food, and heavy equipment from Rabaul to Guadalcanal. He also sent a warship support force from Truk on 9 November which included the battleships {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2}}. Equipped with special [[fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] [[Shell (projectile)|shells]], they were to bombard Henderson Field on the night of 12–13 November and destroy it and the aircraft stationed there in order to allow the slow, heavy transports to reach Guadalcanal and unload safely the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;225–238; Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;41–46. The 11 transport ships provided to carry the troops, equipment, and provisions included ''Arizona Maru'', ''Kumagawa Maru'', ''Sado Maru'', ''Nagara Maru'', ''Nako Maru'', ''Canberra Maru'', ''Brisbane Maru'', ''Kinugawa Maru'', ''Hirokawa Maru'', ''Yamaura Maru'', and ''Yamatsuki Maru''.&lt;/ref&gt; The warship force was commanded from ''Hiei'' by recently promoted Vice Admiral [[Hiroaki Abe]].&lt;ref&gt;Hammel, ''Guadalcanal:  Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;93.&lt;/ref&gt;\nBecause of the constant threat by Japanese aircraft and warships, it was difficult for Allied forces to resupply their forces on Guadalcanal, which were often under attack from Imperial land and sea forces in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt; In early November 1942, Allied [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] learned that the Japanese were preparing again to try to retake Henderson Field.&lt;ref&gt;Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the U.S. sent Task Force&amp;nbsp;67 (TF&amp;nbsp;67)—a large reinforcement and re-supply convoy, split into two groups and commanded by [[Rear Admiral]] [[Richmond K. Turner]]—to Guadalcanal on 11 November. The supply ships were protected by two [[task force|task group]]s—commanded by Rear Admirals [[Daniel J. Callaghan]] and [[Norman Scott (admiral)|Norman Scott]]—and aircraft from [[Honiara International Airport|Henderson Field]] on Guadalcanal.&lt;ref&gt;Kilpatrick, ''Naval Night Battles'', p.&amp;nbsp;79–80; Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;38–39; Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;227–233, 231–233; Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;429–430. The American reinforcements totaled 5,500 men and included the 1st Marine Aviation Engineer Battalion, replacements for ground and air units, the 4th&amp;nbsp;Marine Replacement Battalion, two battalions of the U.S. Army's [[182nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|182nd Infantry Regiment]], and ammunition and supplies. The first transport group, TF&amp;nbsp;67.1, was commanded by Captain Ingolf N. Kiland and included {{USS|McCawley|APA-4|2}}, {{USS|Crescent City|APA-21|2}}, {{USS|President Adams|APA-19|2}}, and {{USS|President Jackson|APA-18|2}}. The second transport group, part of Task Group&amp;nbsp;62.4 (TG&amp;nbsp;62.4), consisted of {{USS|Betelgeuse|AKA-11|2}}, {{USS|Libra|AKA-12|2}}, and {{USS|Zeilin|APA-3|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The transport ships were attacked several times on 11 and 12 November near Guadalcanal by Japanese aircraft based at Buin, [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], in the Solomons, but most were unloaded without serious damage. Twelve Japanese aircraft were shot down by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] fire from the U.S. ships or by [[fighter aircraft]] flying from Henderson Field.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;432; Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;50–90; Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;229–230.&lt;/ref&gt;\n==First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 13 November==\n===Prelude===\n[[File:GuadalcanalCloseup.png|300px|thumb|right|Guadalcanal locator map and close up]]\nAbe's warship force assembled {{convert|70|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} north of [[Indispensable Strait]] and proceeded towards Guadalcanal on 12 November with an estimated arrival time for the warships of early morning of 13 November. The convoy of slower transport ships and 12 escorting destroyers, under the command of [[Raizo Tanaka]], began its run down &quot;[[The Slot]]&quot; (New Georgia Sound) from the Shortlands with an estimated arrival time at Guadalcanal during the night of 13 November.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;234; Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;428; Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;92–93.

Tanaka states that there were 12&amp;nbsp;destroyers (Evans, ''Japanese Navy'', p.&amp;nbsp;188).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the battleships {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}} (Abe's flagship) and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2}}, Abe's force included the [[light cruiser]] ''[[Japanese cruiser Nagara|Nagara]]'' and 11&amp;nbsp;[[destroyer]]s ({{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Samidare||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Murasame|1937|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Asagumo|1938|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Teruzuki||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Amatsukaze||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Yukikaze||2}}, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Ikazuchi|1931|2}}, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Inazuma|1932|2}}, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Akatsuki|1932|2}}, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Harusame|1937|2}}, and {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Yūdachi|1937|2}}).&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;233–234; Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;103–105. Rear Admiral [[Susumu Kimura]] commanded Destroyer Squadron&amp;nbsp;10, including ''Amatsukaze'', ''Yukikaze'', ''Akatsuki'', ''Ikazuchi'', ''Inazuma'', and ''Teruzuki'' from ''Nagara''. Rear Admiral [[Tamotsu Takama]] commanded Destroyer Squadron&amp;nbsp;4 which included ''Asagumo'', ''Murasame'', ''Samidare'', ''Yūdachi'', and ''Harusame''.&lt;/ref&gt; Three more destroyers ({{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Shigure||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Shiratsuyu||2}}, and {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Yūgure|1934|2}}) would provide a rear guard in the [[Russell Islands]] during Abe's foray into the waters of'' &quot;Savo Sound&quot; ''around and near [[Savo Island]] off the north coast of Guadalcanal that would soon be nicknamed &quot;[[Ironbottom Sound]]&quot; as a result of this succession of battles and skirmishes.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;429.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. [[reconnaissance]] aircraft spotted the approach of the Japanese ships and passed a warning to the Allied command.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;235; Hara, ''Japanese Destroyer Captain'', p.&amp;nbsp;137.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus warned, Turner detached all usable combat ships to protect the troops ashore from the expected Japanese naval attack and troop landing and ordered the supply ships at Guadalcanal to depart by the early evening of 12 November. Callaghan was a few days' [[seniority|senior]] to the more experienced Scott, and therefore was placed in overall command.&lt;ref&gt;Kilpatrick, ''Naval Night Battles'', p.&amp;nbsp;83–85; Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;236–237; Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;92. Turner and the transport ships safely reached Espiritu Santo on 15 November.&lt;/ref&gt;\nCallaghan prepared his force to meet the Japanese that night in the sound. His force comprised two [[heavy cruiser]]s ({{USS|San Francisco|CA-38|2}} and {{USS|Portland|CA-33|2}}), three [[light cruiser]]s ({{USS|Helena|CL-50|2}}, {{USS|Juneau|CL-52|2}}, and {{USS|Atlanta|CL-51|2}}), and eight [[destroyer]]s: {{USS|Cushing|DD-376|2}}, {{USS|Laffey|DD-459|2}}, {{USS|Sterett|DD-407|2}}, {{USS|O'Bannon|DD-450|2}}, {{USS|Aaron Ward|DD-483|2}}, {{USS|Barton|DD-599|2}}, {{USS|Monssen|DD-436|2}}, and {{USS|Fletcher|DD-445|2}}.

Five ships had the new, far-superior [[radar|SG radar]], but Callaghan's deployment put none of them in the forward part of the column, nor did he choose one for his [[flagship]].

This experience would be telling in not only the pending encounter, but in several other fleet actions off Guadalcanal in the months to come.&lt;ref name=&quot;frank437&quot;/&gt;\nSeveral of the U.S. ships detected the approaching Japanese on radar, beginning at about 01:24, but had trouble communicating the information to Callaghan due to problems with radio equipment, lack of discipline regarding communications procedures, and general inexperience in operating as a cohesive naval unit.&lt;ref&gt;Kilpatrick, ''Naval Night Battles'', p.&amp;nbsp;86–89; Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;124–126; Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;239–240.&lt;/ref&gt; Messages were sent and received but did not reach the commander in time to be processed and used.

Lacking a modern [[Operations room|Combat Information Center (CIC)]], where incoming information could be quickly processed and co-ordinated, the radar operator was reporting on vessels that were not in sight, while Callaghan was trying to coordinate the battle visually, from the bridge.&lt;ref name=&quot;guadalcanal438&quot;/&gt; (Post battle analysis of this and other early surface actions would lead directly to the introduction of modern CICs early in 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;guadalcanal438&quot;/&gt;)\nSeveral minutes after initial radar contact the two forces sighted each other, at about the same time, but both Abe and Callaghan hesitated ordering their ships into action. Abe was apparently surprised by the proximity of the U.S. ships, and with decks stacked with high explosive (rather than armor penetrating) munitions, was momentarily uncertain if he should withdraw to give his battleships time to rearm, or continue onward.

From the beach it resembled a door to hell opening and closing... over and over.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''The Story of World War II'' p.&amp;nbsp;134-135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\nAfter nearly 40 minutes of brutal, close-quarters fighting, the two sides broke contact and ceased fire at 02:26, after Abe and Captain Gilbert Hoover (the captain of ''Helena'' and senior surviving U.S. officer) ordered their respective forces to disengage.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;451.&lt;/ref&gt; Admiral Abe had one battleship (''Kirishima''), one light cruiser (''Nagara''), and four destroyers (''Asagumo'', ''Teruzuki'', ''Yukikaze'', and ''Harusame'') with only light damage and four destroyers (''Inazuma'', ''Ikazuchi'', ''Murasame'', and ''Samidare'') with moderate damage. The U.S. had only one light cruiser (''Helena'') and one destroyer (''Fletcher'') that were still capable of effective resistance. Although perhaps unclear to Abe, the way was now clear for him to bombard Henderson Field and finish off the U.S. naval forces in the area, thus allowing the troops and supplies to be landed safely on Guadalcanal.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;449–450.&lt;/ref&gt;\nHowever, at this crucial juncture, Abe chose to abandon the mission and depart the area. Several reasons are conjectured as to why he made this decision. Much of the special bombardment ammunition had been expended in the battle. If the bombardment failed to destroy the airfield, then his warships would be vulnerable to CAF air attack at dawn. His own injuries and the deaths of some of his staff from battle action may have affected Abe's judgement. Perhaps he was also unsure as to how many of his or the U.S. ships were still combat-capable because of communication problems with the damaged ''Hiei''. Furthermore, his own ships were scattered and would have taken some time to reassemble for a coordinated resumption of the mission to attack Henderson Field and the remnants of the U.S. warship force. For whatever reason, Abe called for a disengagement and general retreat of his warships, although ''Yukikaze'' and ''Teruzuki'' remained behind to assist ''Hiei''.&lt;ref&gt;Hara, ''Japanese Destroyer Captain'', p.&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Samidare'' picked up survivors from ''Yūdachi'' at 03:00 before joining the other Japanese ships in the retirement northwards.&lt;ref name =&quot;guadalcanal452&quot;&gt;Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;452.&lt;/ref&gt;\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:HieiB17Nov13.gif|thumb|''Hiei'', trailing oil, is bombed by U.S. B-17 bombers from high altitude north of Savo Island on 13 November 1942.]]\n[[File:Portland in Sydney 1942.jpg|thumb|right|''Portland'' undergoing repairs in dry dock in Sydney, Australia, a month after the battle]]\nAt 03:00 on 13 November, Admiral Yamamoto postponed the planned landings of the transports, which returned to the Shortlands to await further orders.&lt;ref name=&quot;guadalcanal452&quot;/&gt; Dawn revealed three crippled Japanese (''Hiei'', ''Yūdachi'', and ''Amatsukaze''), and three crippled U.S.&amp;nbsp;ships (''Portland'', ''Atlanta'', and ''Aaron Ward'') in the general vicinity of Savo Island.&lt;ref&gt;Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;270.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Amatsukaze'' was attacked by U.S. dive bombers but escaped further damage as she headed to Truk, and eventually returned to action several months later.

Abe and his staff transferred to ''Yukikaze'' at 08:15. ''Kirishima'' was ordered by Abe to take ''Hiei'' under tow, escorted by ''Nagara'' and its destroyers, but the attempt was cancelled because of the threat of submarine attack and ''Hiei''{{'}}s increasing unseaworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;Kilpatrick, ''Naval Night Battles'', p.&amp;nbsp;79 and 97–100; Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;298–308.&lt;/ref&gt; After sustaining more damage from air attacks, ''Hiei'' sank northwest of Savo Island, perhaps after being scuttled by her remaining crew, in the late evening of 13 November.&lt;ref&gt;Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;298–308; Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;259–160.

Reportedly furious, Admiral Yamamoto relieved Abe of command and later directed his forced retirement from the military. However, it appears that Yamamoto may have been more angry over the loss of one of his battleships (''Hiei'') than he was over the abandonment of the supply mission and failure to completely destroy the U.S. force.&lt;ref&gt;Hara, ''Japanese Destroyer Captain'', p.&amp;nbsp;156.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly before noon, Yamamoto ordered Vice Admiral [[Nobutake Kondō]], commanding the Second Fleet at Truk, to form a new bombardment unit around ''Kirishima'' and attack Henderson Field on the night of 14–15 November.&lt;ref&gt;Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;401; Hara, ''Japanese Destroyer Captain'', p.&amp;nbsp;156.&lt;/ref&gt;\nIncluding the sinking of ''Juneau'', total U.S. losses in the battle were 1,439 dead.

Following close behind, ''South Dakota'' suddenly suffered a series of electrical failures, reportedly during repairs when her chief engineer locked down a [[circuit breaker]] in violation of safety procedures, causing her circuits repeatedly to go into [[Series and parallel circuits|series]], making her radar, radios, and most of her gun batteries inoperable. However, she continued to follow ''Washington'' towards the western side of Savo Island until 23:35, when ''Washington'' changed course left to pass to the southward behind the burning destroyers. ''South Dakota'' tried to follow but had to turn to right to avoid ''Benham'' which resulted in the ship being silhouetted by the fires of the burning destroyers and made her a closer and easier target for the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Lippman, ''Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal'', Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;477–478; Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;384–385; Morison, ''The Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;275–277.&lt;/ref&gt;\nReceiving reports of the destruction of the U.S. destroyers from ''Ayanami'' and his other ships, Kondo pointed his bombardment force towards Guadalcanal, believing that the U.S. warship force had been defeated.

''Washington'' steered a northwesterly course toward the [[Russell Islands]] to draw the Japanese force away from Guadalcanal and the presumably damaged ''South Dakota''. The Imperial ships finally sighted ''Washington'' and launched several torpedo attacks, but by the skilled seamanship of her captain she avoided all of them and also avoided running aground in shallow waters. At length, believing that the way was clear for the transport convoy to proceed to Guadalcanal (but apparently disregarding the threat of air attack in the morning), Kondo ordered his remaining ships to break contact and retire from the area about 01:04, which most of the Japanese warships complied with by 01:30.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;483–484.&lt;/ref&gt;\n===Aftermath===\n''Ayanami'' was [[scuttling|scuttled]] by ''Uranami'' at 2:00, while ''Kirishima'' capsized and sank by 03:25 on 15 November.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''The Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;281; Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;391.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uranami'' rescued survivors from ''Ayanami'' and destroyers ''Asagumo'', ''Teruzuki'', and ''Samidare'' rescued the remaining crew from ''Kirishima''.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;484; ''Atago'', ''Takao'', and ''Nagara'' returned to Japan for repairs, with all three being out of action for about one month.

The transports were attacked, beginning at 05:55 by U.S.&amp;nbsp;aircraft from Henderson Field and elsewhere, and field artillery from U.S. ground forces on Guadalcanal. Later, destroyer {{USS|Meade|DD-602|2}} approached and opened fire on the beached transports and surrounding area. These attacks set the transports afire and destroyed any equipment on them that the Japanese had not already managed to unload. Only 2,000–3,000 of the troops originally embarked actually made it to Guadalcanal, and most of their ammunition and food supplies were lost.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, ''Japanese Navy'', p.&amp;nbsp;195–197; Morison, ''The Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;282–284; Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;394–395; Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;488–490; Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p.&amp;nbsp;307–308. Morison and Jersey state that 2,000&amp;nbsp;Japanese soldiers landed with 260&amp;nbsp;cases of ammunition and 1,500&amp;nbsp;bags of rice. Lost were provisions for 30,000 men for 20&amp;nbsp;days, 22,000 artillery shells, thousands of cases of small-arms ammunition, and 76&amp;nbsp;large and seven small landing craft. Realizing that the transports would not have enough time to unload before daybreak, Tanaka asked permission to run them aground. Mikawa rejected his request, but Kondo accepted it, so Tanaka ordered the transport captains to run their ships aground. The American artillery that shelled the beached transports was from the 244th&amp;nbsp;Coast Artillery Battalion and 3rd&amp;nbsp;Defense Battalion, including two {{convert|155|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns and several 5-inch guns.&lt;/ref&gt;\nYamamoto's reaction to Kondo's failure to accomplish his mission of neutralizing Henderson Field and ensuring the safe landing of troops and supplies was milder than his earlier reaction to Abe's withdrawal, perhaps because of Imperial Navy culture and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Hara, ''Japanese Destroyer Captain'', p.&amp;nbsp;157.&lt;/ref&gt; Kondo, who also held the position of second in command of the Combined Fleet, was a member of the upper staff and battleship &quot;clique&quot; of the Imperial Navy while Abe was a career destroyer specialist.

Thereafter, the Imperial Navy was only able to deliver subsistence supplies and a few replacement troops to Japanese Army forces on Guadalcanal. Because of the continuing threat from Allied aircraft based at Henderson Field, plus nearby U.S. [[aircraft carrier]]s, the Japanese had to continue to rely on Tokyo Express warship deliveries to their forces on Guadalcanal. However, these supplies and replacements were not enough to sustain Japanese troops on the island, who – by 7 December 1942 – were losing about 50 men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks. On 12 December, the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned. Despite initial opposition from Japanese Army leaders, who still hoped that Guadalcanal could eventually be retaken from the Allies, Japan's [[Imperial General Headquarters]]—with approval from the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]]—agreed on 31 December to the [[Operation Ke|evacuation]] of all Japanese forces from the island and establishment of a new line of defense for the Solomons on [[New Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;Dull, ''Imperial Japanese Navy'', p.&amp;nbsp;261; Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;527; Morison, ''The Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;286–287.&lt;/ref&gt;\n[[File:KinugawaMaru1.jpg|thumb|right|The wreck of one of the four Japanese transports &quot;Kinugawa Maru&quot; beached and destroyed at Guadalcanal on 15 November 1942, photographed one year later.]]\n[[File:GuadJapaneseSubandShip.jpg|thumb|right|The wreck of the &quot;Yamazuki Maru&quot; and a Japanese [[midget submarine]] off Guadalcanal.]]\nThus, the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal was the last major attempt by the Japanese to seize control of the seas around Guadalcanal or to retake the island. In contrast, the U.S. Navy was thereafter able to resupply the U.S. forces at Guadalcanal at will, including the delivery of two fresh divisions by late December 1942. The inability to neutralize Henderson Field doomed the Japanese effort to successfully combat the Allied conquest of Guadalcanal.&lt;ref name=&quot;guadalcanal400&quot;/&gt; The last Japanese resistance in the Guadalcanal campaign ended on 9 February 1943, with the successful evacuation of most of the surviving Japanese troops from the island by the Japanese Navy in [[Operation Ke]]. Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their campaign against Japan, ultimately culminating in Japan's defeat and the end of World War II. U.S. President [[Franklin Roosevelt]], upon learning of the results of the battle commented, &quot;It would seem that the turning point in this war has at last been reached.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;428–92; Dull, ''Imperial Japanese Navy'', p.&amp;nbsp;245–69; Morison, ''The Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p.&amp;nbsp;286–287.&lt;/ref&gt;\nHistorian [[Eric M.

After November&amp;nbsp;15, 1942, its leaders lost heart and it lacked the strategic depth to face the burgeoning U.S. Navy and its vastly improving weapons and tactics. The Japanese never got better while, after November 1942, the U.S. Navy never stopped getting better.&lt;ref&gt;Hammel, ''Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea'', p.&amp;nbsp;402.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\nGeneral [[Alexander Vandegrift]], the commander of the troops on Guadalcanal, paid tribute to the sailors who fought the battle:\n&lt;blockquote&gt;We believe the enemy has undoubtedly suffered a crushing defeat. We thank Admiral Kinkaid for his intervention yesterday. We thank Lee for his sturdy effort last night. Our own aircraft has been grand in its relentless hammering of the foe. All those efforts are appreciated but our greatest homage goes to Callaghan, Scott and their men who with magnificent courage against seemingly hopeless odds drove back the first hostile attack and paved the way for the success to follow.
